Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,1, 4.0 , Part of the magic for me growing up as a boy was to buy (or be given) the new Hornby catalogue every year even if it included 90% of the same products as the previous year.  Ive still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,2, 5.0 , Amazing detail every credit to the photographer in this book a worthy reference manual as well as a sales brochure. even if you only have a passing interest in the hobby you will be transported to another time when we were all younger and in awe of the big trains.
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,3, 5.0 , This was purchased on behalf of my Dad. He is always asking me to look up 00 gauge engines online so this has been a good buy as he can look at it anytime. Would definitely buy the next one 2015!It arrived quickly and in perfect condition :-)
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,4, 5.0 , Everything I really needed to see what was on offer from Hornby in the way of trains.  Would not have minded it included an RRP as well though 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,5, 1.0 , I collect them all as the glossy pictures are great and it is nice that you can still get catalogs to collect.
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,6, 1.0 , What a great book.  Extremely useful insight to all future christmas presents.
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,7, 5.0 , Useful info for someonelike me starting back into the hobby after many years
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,8, 5.0 , A well produced very good quality catalogue.Super quality pictures.
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,9, 4.0 , Very happy with the communication with funkybuys 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,10, 1.0 , Great buy.
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,11, 1.0 , Simple & GREAT FUN for 5+My nephews face was amazing when he opened this for his birthday!! His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke it literally did!)Its very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble it takes 2 mins. Its very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if theyre very interested in trains. This gets them started in the hobby and doesnt cost much at all!
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,12, 1.0 , Excellent product everybody should have one or to of product  excellent  100 percent ok speedy delivery excellent i give it five stars CLASSIC TOY TRAIN SET TRACK CARRIAGES LIGHT ENGINE BOXED BOYS KIDS BATTERYdouble aa battery goes in top of engine
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,13, 1.0 , I was extremely pleased with the train set really good value for money.
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,14, 1.0 , i found this item not suitable for young children  very difficult to keep the carriages together and the whole thing kept coming off the track.All very thin plastic. I would not recommend this item. 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,15, 1.0 , The Train did not work  and as it was a present for my young nephew for Christmas I was very disappointed but as it was only £7 it was not worth the fuss of ordering another 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,16, 4.0 , Better than expected. It has a proper oval of track rather than just a circle. My 2 year old grandsn loves it although he finds it difficult to put on the track. 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,17, 5.0 , Brilliant little train.  Bought for my son who was looking for a train that looks like the polar express - he was not disappointed.  Great value. 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,18, 3.0 , train carriages kept falling track  of and the connectors not good. better on the floor
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,19, 5.0 , I love it. Perfect with the earlier ordered locomotive.Again: I would recommend it to the masters of the topic. Its not just a toy.
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,20, 5.0 , Bought this for my Grandsons birthday.  He is currently collecting some bits for his train set.  Keeps him away from the TV and computers.  So think it was well worth it. 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,21, 4.0 , only four this time i here you say but i still highly recommend this product as it is a very well engineered piece of equipment and a very worth while addition to every railway enthusiasts collection young or old alike even those who are just starting out this is a good place to get started she also has the lines (a good body) she is neat sweet and petite she also came well boxed and securely wrapped she also came in on time and delivered by courteous gentleman  again many thanks 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,22, 5.0 , A beautiful little model engine of years gone by.
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,23, 5.0 , the victorian style added to the character that my husband was trying to acheve with his model train layout
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,24, 1.0 , Good value
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,25, 5.0 , High standard model well worth the wait.  Replaces a model of a Utility Van that has been in production by Triang and Hornby since the 1950s! 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,26, 4.0 , This a good wagon - thanks
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,27, 5.0 , This has gone down very well this Christmas. Adults and kids collectively enjoy its appearance from around the Christmas tree.Whilst I use this as effectively a Christmas tree decoration it is nevertheless a quality Hornby OO gauge model in its own right and could be used year round for a modelling enthusiast.A word of warning would be that the model is delicate and intricate. If you have cats for example they are sure to damage the delicate parts as they seek to derail the train from the track.
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,28, 1.0 , My 1st Hornby and I absolutely love it. It will look amazing under my Christmas Tree this year too. Takes minutes to set up and works great. Smooth quiet and fantastic.
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,29, 1.0 , Excellent value for money and fits around the base of most Christmas trees. My little boy loved it!!
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,30, 5.0 , Perfect Christmas present for the big kid ordered as a Christmas gift for my dad he loves trains. It arrived on time and looks great.
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,31, 1.0 , As Usual top quality Hornby quality lovely cute set which kids of all ages will adore
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,32, 5.0 , This was a fantastic item and has finally made my Christmas village scene for all to enjoy. Thank you very much.
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,33, 1.0 , Great price arrived in good time packaged well appears to be new and original presentation of train package looks good the train looks fab (realistic) and works well.  My little boy was thrilled...  Pity it didnt make any sounds...
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,34, 1.0 , Really disappointed - train worked twice and then power unit stopped working just in time for Christmas. Son was really excited but the whole controller unit felt flimsy which seems to have been proved by its decision to conk out.
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,35, 1.0 , Xmas box for grandsonam sure it will be great
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,36, 4.0 , We bought this (and 2 others)for our grandsons and they love them. They now have about 7 and it can get a bit noisy if they decide to press the buttons on all of them at once. they are only 3 and 18 months at the moment and dont play unsupervised! 
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,37, 4.0 , This product was a gift for my nephew and he is enjoying playing with it with all the other chuggington interactive trains he got for christmas and so far it is doing everything we expected it to. 
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,38, 1.0 , We all loved these chugginton trains and have fun getting them to talk to each other.  My grandson now has six of them and takes them to bed with him.
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,39, 5.0 , This is a great addition to the interactive train set all the trains interact with each other. My daughter gets hours of play out of them!
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,40, 1.0 , Grandson loved it. Hauls good load
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,41, 5.0 , Very good product. Thank you.
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,42, 1.0 , very good
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,43, 5.0 , Beautiful model If your a fan of the G.W.R this loco is a must have Just that. 
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,44, 5.0 , Christmas gift for him in doors he will love it 
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,45, 5.0 , runs very smooth good model
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,46, 1.0 , Great quality lots of detail run nic and smooth great little engine
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,47, 1.0 , Fantastic little set beautifully made and a decent price.
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,75, 5.0 , The product is as expected.  The only worry is it looks like the connections will easily break - not robust
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,49, 5.0 , Very happy with product
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,50, 3.0 , My 2 year old loves chuggington so we decided to get her this set. To be fair i dont think there is much longevity with it and after a while my daughter played with the train itself rather than the train and track although it does still come out now and again. I had read some reviews that you have to keep building the track as it comes apart easily. I think that depends on if your child is heavy handed or not i havent had to keep putting it back together but i could see that if a child was a bit heavy handed then you would be up and down all the time. I have taught my 2 year old to try and put it back together on her own and she can mangae to do some bits but does force them together if they are round the wrong way but time will cure that. Overall yes im glad i got it for her and i dont regret buying it there are better products out there or might be just worth getting them the trains on there own. 
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,58, 5.0 , We have a lot of fun time with my son with this series. It also helps imagination and construction skills as he is building a different rail root every day
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,52, 4.0 , Lovely quality from Kato.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,53, 5.0 , I NOW HAVE A SECOND OF THESE BACHMANN POWERHAULS COMING AS THEY CAN TAKE REAL TRAINS BETWEEN 20-30 WAGONSOF A HEAVY WEIGHT.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,54, 5.0 , This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a white enclosed coach with a pair of white horses and two figures on the (red) driving seat dressed in a grey livery. One is a man in a grey greatcoat and top hat the other is a female in a grey coat or uniform jacket and grey jockey-style of cap. There do not appear to be figures inside but if you look through the back window these are heads visible. This is a striking model and would be an excellent decoration for almost any diorama.As you would expect from Preiser these figures are of a high quality of manufacture detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £20 for my set so it pays to shop around in your local model shops – or even a distant one. I live in London but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,55, 5.0 , This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a long wooden wagon bearing a very long barrel or wooden cylinder with two horses hauling it and a driver seated on a driving bench. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser these figures are of a high quality of manufacture detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £20 for my set so it pays to shop around in your local model shops – or even a distant one. I live in London but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,56, 5.0 , Beautiful little model which I wholeheartedly reccommend.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,57, 5.0 , A nice little train for our layout and a change. Up to the usual Takara Tomy high standard. The little front light is not that bright but looks OK.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,58, 5.0 , Excellent model in perfect condition from reputeable amazon seller however it was returned for a refund because its couplings were not compatable with my other Railjet coaches. I was previously ignorant of the fact that Roco Railjet coaches with internal lighting do not have the same couplings as those without. Roco Railjet coaches 64722 / 64723 / 64724 have internal lighting powered through connections in the couplings.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,59, 5.0 , Got these for my 2 yr old - hes obsessed with trains and loves these characters. They are pretty tough so have survived some bashing. Only thing is that he cant get them to attach to each other with the ball/ socket joint its a bit fiddly so I have to help with that (repeatedly as they do come apart quite easily!) However this wont be an issue as he gets older. Only got Brewster and Wilson this time to see how he got on but think I will be getting the track and Koko for xmas as he plays with these for ages and loves talking to them (not sure he realises the trains talk to each other he just thinks they talk to him... could be setting myself up for years of counselling with that :) 
Cosette,Sumpter,8/17/2002,60, 5.0 , I bought the whole set of chuggington interactive trains and train set for my grandsons to play with when they come to visit which is only twice a year as they live in Italy.  I think I have had more fun with them listening to them speak to each other I am absolutely fascinated with them. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,61, 2.0 , The toy is much larger than other Chugginton toys and doesnt fit on any of the Chuggington rail tracks. Cue disappointed 3 year old. I think this should have been clearer from the description of the toy.Otherwise it works fine and is as described. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,62, 1.0 , I purchased this as well as old Puffer Pete and extra track too for my little 2 year old grandson and he and Daddy love it ..Perfect well made and delivered fast too. 5 stars for a 1st class product and seller too.
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,63, 4.0 , My 4yr old loves these trains. They are fun when they talk to each other & helps to build up an interactive imaginative game. Not the most robust of toys but fine for kids who dont play too roughly! 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,64, 5.0 , I bought this for my son who has a Chuggington train set and its definitely worth having at least 2trains to interact with each other. It took his enjoyment of the track to another level. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,65, 4.0 , Bought for our 2 yr old twin boys to build up their collection great interactive toy and works well with the other Chugginton characters we have. Fast delivery also 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,66, 5.0 , Good size very sturdy and well made. The interaction between the trains is very good. Not easy to break very easy to couple the trains together. Great product
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,67, 5.0 , We love Tomica!
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,68, 5.0 , It seems as though we are gradually purchasing all of the die cast trains for our 3 year old to play with on his Take Along & Take N Play track. Got this one for his birthday; Molly being yellow was great as this is my sons favourite colour. He spends hours making different tracks and then playing with the trains making up stories. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,69, 5.0 , my boy and girl love molly. especially my 14 month old daughter - seems to have really taken to this yellow engine! good product and great delivery. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,58, 5.0 , My son has a large collection of his trains and they are fantastic well worth the money! Only downside the paint scratches easily.
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,75, 5.0 , My grandchildren loved Molly I thought she was well made and very pretty. A very nice addition to there Thomas collection.
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,72, 4.0 , Have to say that this is a lovely itemif a tad expensivebut still a little gem.I managed to get mine at a bargain pricebut if you can too then it is well worth having.My biggest incentive in buying this was to be able to add two extra wooden/teak ex-LNER coaches to the three I already have from the Rare Bird set from the Barry J Freeman range.Those three teaks are very difficult to add todue to most coaches being LNER & not BR.This set means you can have a rake of five!The detail on them is utterly sublime & they are stunninga tenfold better than the teaks in the railroad range.If only they made a BR-numbered buffet car!As for the lovely black British Railways N2 tank loco-well that too is a lovely itemgreat little runner & puller.Only drawback is that the locomotive is not digitally/DCC ready as far as I gather.Not VFM if you consider how much is being outlaid.It comes with a numbered certificate & very attractively decorative box......I give it an eight out of tenwith marks lost on cost & the lack of an easy to fit DCC socket... 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,73, 4.0 , Hornby R2981 London 1948 train pack with Class N2 BR ex-LNER Brake Composite coach & ex-LNER Full 3rd coach. Olympics Limited Edition. Another beautiful limited edition from Hornby that is an excellent detailed train pack for use or collection : 00 gauge : Individually numbered certificate the official product of London 2012. Class N2 - Motor: 5 pole Skew wound - DCC ready : Pristine finish : Special Features : Sprung buffers Extensive Detail NEM couplings. Shop around for the best price as these have been reduced by Hornby to half price sale some months ago. 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,74, 4.0 , Whilst the purists complain that this is not an entirely accurate 1948 train (the locomotive was apparently based in Scotland and did not have remote control systems fitted as the model has) it is a great souvenir and the coaches are of extraordinary quality. I suspect it will be a good investment better than any bank at the moment and better made than most Olympic memorabilia 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,75, 5.0 , The carriages - what can I say - I would suspect the best ready to run ever made - the challenge of the teak effect completely mastered plus absurd levels of detail
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,76, 5.0 , it was as advertised and delivered promptly 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,77, 5.0 , Easy to wire looks great on the layout. 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,78, 4.0 , Very satisfied thank you 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,79, 5.0 , thank you
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,80, 5.0 , Lol
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,210, 5.0 , Great product for the price of the TTS sound Im very impressed
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,82, 5.0 , Elizabeth is a very feisty truck who stands no nonsense from a lot of silly trains. A great addition to the collection 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,83, 5.0 , My three year old boy absolutely loved this! Very sturdy design - ideal for small children to play with. Brilliant! 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,84, 5.0 , My Son Loved the series and the Take Along Vehicles.
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,85, 4.0 , This was a present for my brother.  He said it is brilliant and has enjoyed making it. The service I received was good and although it took a little while to arrive it was worth the wait.
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,86, 5.0 , I found no issues with these at all they are great for my son who has sensory issues he walked around everywhere with them bought them after the occupational therapists adviced us we have had them a few weeks now and they still work as good as the day we got them I would highly recommend them.
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,87, 5.0 , An excellent product at an excellent price !! 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,88, 4.0 , Runs well with hornby dcc decoder.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,89, 1.0 , A great addition to the Kato Glacier Express set bringing your train up to a respectable length and it comes in a quality presentation case. Delivery from Japan only takes a couple of weeks. Well worth the money.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,90, 1.0 , Great value although shipped from Japan arrived in good time.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,91, 4.0 , This is a pretty decent starter set as a first step into model railways.You get a very nice detailed model of the Gloucester City and its tender and three equally well-detailed model coaches. The locomotive is DCC-ready. (DCC is the digital control system for model railways allowing different trains to run at different speeds o the same tracks - DCC-ready indicates that the loco has a socket into which a DCC module can be slotted in future; the controller provided with the set is not DCC-compatible.)As with all Hornby starter sets there is sufficient track included for a simple oval circuit with a single siding and one set of points. Hornby points are a bit flimsy - they dont seem to click as positively into one side or the other as I remember those on the model railways of my youth doing but the track is fine otherwise. The fishplates are reassuringly tight and it all slots together easily. There is also a trackmat supplied which is a rather grand name for a large printed sheet of glossy paper with a suggested layout to make all of which requires you to buy rather a lot of extra track and accessories - more a piece of marketing than anything really useful.The supplied controller is a simple rheostat - you can turn the speed up and down and select forward or reverse but its all you need to get started. (If you get keen you can buy a DCC module for the locomotive and a DCC controller to give more control options for a more sophisticated layout.)Putting it all together took 20 minutes or so - its reasonably obvious how you assemble it all which is fortunate as the supplied instructions are a bit sketchy. Not really a problem as most bits will only fit one way!Read more › 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,92, 4.0 , A typical Hornby starter set. The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it and for a railroad model the detail is very good! The Pullman coaches are equally attractive to look at and feel as though they will last a good while. The track included while a fairly minimal amount is sufficient to get the set moving comfortably. The only downside in my opinion is the controller feels very cheap. I would not expect to see much use from it. However for the fact I am viewing this as simply a test model for something much larger it will not see too much heavy use anyway. The loco runs smoothly and quietly and I cant wait to see it running on a much larger layout! 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,93, 1.0 , Great item as usual from HornbyLoco is well detailed above Hornbys Railroad versions in my opinion.A nice quality set far too good for younger children who would easily damage though a good starter set for the enthusiast.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,94, 4.0 , This is a lovely set to own and my only serious reservation is that you really need to spend quite a lot more on extras to get the best out of it. As a starting point its great though.The track is good-quality but does need a flat solid base. Youll need to spend time getting the creases out of the supplied 1600x1180mm MidiMat too.The detailing on the locomotive and carriages is pretty good. The conn rods move nicely and you can see inside the carriages with their white `table cloths and gold-coloured lamps. It could be better still but most people will be perfectly happy with it as I am.The box suggests all sorts of further sets to enhance this one. The Basic Oval and Track Pack A (R8221) are included to create an extended oval with a siding. Adding Track Packs B and C (R8222 and R8223) gives you a double oval with siding (but just one pair of points connecting them). D and E (R8224 and R8225) make it really interesting but thats almost £100 so far and you can still add F (R8226) for extra sidings. Oh and youll need a new 1800x1200 TrakMat R8217 to go with packs E and F.Then youll want to add accessories such as stations signal boxes and engine sheds. The message is...dont imagine £150 for this set will be the end of your expenditure!Without at least the extra track the set will be pretty dull unless you just want to go round and round in circles with the occasional foray into the siding. Hence 1 star deducted for fun.Some parts notably some of the couplings seem rather fragile. I wouldnt recommend this set for younger children and would suggest 8 as an absolute minimum and only with a lot of adult supervision. 10 or 12 would be better.Read more › 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,95, 4.0 , This is the railroad version of the Duke of Gloucester which is slightly less detailed than the top of the range model and consequently less fragile. The three Pullman coaches are also from the Railroad range and do not have interior lighting as do the top of the range models. It is a pity that the roofs are silver and a bit flashy they would have been better in grey. Another slight inconvenience is that the couplings do not match. The loco has the newer style couplings and the coaches the wider older style but this does not impede hooking up however. This train set was a real bargain at the price I paid at the time.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,96, 5.0 , Although an ex.LMS Stanier prototype this very simple kit from Dapol makes a good generic non-corridor carriage fairly representive of those produced by the Big Four railway companies prior to nationalisation. Derived from ex.Mainline/Airfix tooling these very straightforward kits are a very attractively priced alternative to the increasingly highly priced ready to run items produced by Hornby and Bachman.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,97, 4.0 , I have not built the model yet but look forward to doing so in due course I have several of these fairground models i enjoy building them and watching them work 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,98, 5.0 , Faller kits are very good quality and if you follow the instructions to the letter your model will be great.Ive not yet started on these kits as yet but I have done 32 others all Faller as well as 5 other makes.Delivery and packing by this supplier was excellent the prices were keen 5 star dealer. 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,99, 5.0 , GREAT ITEM THANX! 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,100, 5.0 , Perfect
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,101, 5.0 , A heavily built unit of excelent quality and exacting standards. Superior to previous incarnations of standard stock and will haul six carriages with relative ease. 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,102, 5.0 , Excellent value and has brought all my rolling stock to the modern age of Digital the Flying Scotsman locomotive has fantastic detail close up and runs so smooth on the tracks it is is a pleasure to see a age of steam. 
Emmey,Sousa,8/22/1978,103, 4.0 , Beaware...says DCC ready but only works after you buy the separate dcc decoder (currently £16)...Well made trainlovely detail  but we had to wait whilst we ordered the decoder..slightly annoying!...hence 4 star 
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,104, 4.0 , It is a lovely hornby train and maybe someday kids can play with it too hee hee. Best regards. G 
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,105, 1.0 , Really impressed with the detail on this model I have several Hornby models and put them in custom glass cases as static models they really look the part!
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,106, 1.0 , Bought as present for my husband. He was delighted with it. Good price and delivered quickly. Would recommend to others with model railway interests.
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,107, 5.0 , Im sure my father will adore his christmas gift. 
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,108, 1.0 , An excellent model very detailed my son actually ended up getting 2 of these for Christmas. The seller wad very understanding and took the product back and issued a full refund without any quibble
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,109, 1.0 , Good buy and good value buy just wot my son wonted a good for model railway across both tracks and easy to assemble no glue needed to put together
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,58, 5.0 , This set arrived on the 27th and was in perfect condition thank you
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,111, 4.0 , grandchildren love itbut it does tend to go round and round a lotdoesnt run well on carpet/rug so need an area thats tiled or laminatedbut well worth the money great value
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,112, 1.0 , This is a finely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways (Epoch 1) baggage/post wagon in the standard epoch 1 green livery with a black roof. It is a bogie vehicle with end vestibule doors and two sliding doors each side with a guards compartment fitted with a `birdcage roof at one end. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows and sliding doors (unfortunately so can one of the screw-fittings for a bogie). The running number is PPu 17660 and there is a destination board for a Munchen to Berlin service.This model is fitted with the standard `loop style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with a transparent plasticky internal tray with side cover.This is a beautifully detailed model as you would expect from Trix and is of a high quality of manufacture. Note that there are other models available to form a rake of the Munch to Berlin coaches.
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,113, 1.0 , An excellent kit of an ex.LMS Stanier non-corridor brake coach that can pass muster as non-corridor stock produced by any of the Big Four railway companies prior to Nationalisation in 1948. Produced from ex.Mainline/Airfix GMR tooling these are simple to assemble kits that are easy to super-detail.
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,114, 1.0 , Really good service and great product. On time for Christmas :)
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,115, 5.0 , Great addition to the auto city set to give a military air to play.
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,116, 4.0 , I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set. 
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,117, 1.0 , Every child should own a train set and lately Ive started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. (And  if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot thats OK too: I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone whilst building titchy windmills).Its nice to see after not handling  a set since the early 70s that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service with both passenger and freight carriages but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.Its very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game and the price is what it is: Theyve always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally whereas this is on an old style analogue controller which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains etc this  set would have to run on a separate track?So Im really glad i own a trainset again and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump.
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,118, 4.0 , My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before but it is clearly well thought out very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set it can be oval or circular and thats about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy very classic but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. Its huge to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around £15-£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example but to go up you need to slope very very gradually otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldnt climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space and once you accept it wont slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle (total of 6) as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more ›
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,119, 1.0 , This model is something all BR modellers will want and comes at a very reasonable price for a DCC fitted loco. will definitely recommend it & the seller
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,120, 4.0 , Fantastic model of a locomotive Ive followed from childhood. NYMR had a fabulous variant steaming and its a joy to behold. 
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,121, 1.0 , FANTASTIC DETAIL HAVE NOT RUN IT YET. BUILD LAYOUT PLANS AT THE AT THIS TIME.
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,122, 1.0 , i am over the moon with this item exemplary service and fantastic value for the item
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,123, 1.0 , Fantastic lamps at a very fair price
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,124, 2.0 , This is a nicely-detailed HO-scale model of a Saxon Sate Railways (Epoch 1) 1st/2nd class express bogie coach - type ABBu - in the standard epoch 1 dark green livery with a light grey roof. This is a very modern style of wooden-framed steel panelled side-corridor coach with a steel chassis and end-vestibule entrances and `concertina connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows such as the partitions and seating and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is 103.This model is fitted with the standard `loop style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Piko card box with a transparent window and a transparent plastic side-opening tray inside.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture with a small packet of delicate bits for you to add. There are other models available to form a rake of these coaches.Note that I paid £37 for my model when new so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops - or even a distant one. I live in London but find it worth hopping on a train to Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,125, 4.0 , Its a power brick what more can be said? This though was the cheapest source for a non to cheap necessity - why it wasnt bundled I dont know! 
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,126, 4.0 , At first I thought it was not for the intended job but was advised that it was working as expected and was doing the job as required so it is a good price and very compact 
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,127, 2.0 , Works well as expected.
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,128, 5.0 , as described 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,129, 5.0 , Just what I wanted
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,130, 5.0 , Top Spin is a very popular fairground/themepark ride seen under different names. I bought this kit to replace my worn out model built about eight years ago as part of my model fairground which I used to exhibit to raise funds for coronary research and childrens CHUF unit at the Freeman Hospital. Much care is required in building these kits to get the best results theyre fun to build and a delight to run. The quality is excellent and instructions concise. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,131, 4.0 , Very good
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,132, 4.0 , This is an excellent addition to any diecast collection and a must for Harry Potter fans. Looks great in its box. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,133, 5.0 , This is a very good quality train. Not one to be played with but defiantly a collectors item for the future. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,134, 5.0 , A great addition to my sons collection well constructed great design and attention to detail.  A great buy for any Harry Potter fan. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,135, 5.0 , Toy was brought as a joke present for my father in law. He is Harry Potter obsessed and he enjoyed this gift very much. It is of good durability and looks very authentic.
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,136, 5.0 , Thanks very well made L&YR 2-4-2 Tank by Bachmann .
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,137, 5.0 , Keeps my husband happy. Well impressed
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,138, 5.0 , I have recently decided to rebuild my model railway after many years being stored in a box.  I needed a controller and decided that a Gaugemaster was a good choice.  As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didnt take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.  I have been using this controller for several weeks now and I am still very pleased with it. 
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,139, 4.0 , Next day free delivery! Very small fits easily in the palm of my hand. Screw terminals for the outputs and plug in supply from the transformer input. Very smooth control of locos.Would have preferred the connections on the bottom of the unit for ease of handling. 
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,140, 5.0 , very happy with my product. works great
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,141, 5.0 , Very good kit goes together very well.
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,142, 5.0 , Walthers Proto F7a locomotive is everything you would expect from this range.  Beautiful prototypical details smoothest running qualities and of course the sounds!  Awesome loco in fantastic packaging - it aint cheap but therein lies the truth.  You can go and buy a Bachmann F7a - and theyre great - but this has the hand rails and that extra feel of a quality product.  Some say that Athearn Genesis are the best - but this is a truly wonderful model that gets prominent place in my F7 collection
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,143, 5.0 , Brilliant! The joy on his face was the picture of Christmas! His reaction when the sound of coal shovelling was heard followed by the toot toot as the train started followed by slow but progressively faster motion of the steam train as it moves left my little boy speechless! A Christmas memory the I will never forget and according to him: my best present ever!Jorge 
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,144, 4.0 , It arrived late this afternoon. Looks gorgeous. However the Flying Scotsman named engine (60103 according to my 1957 abc Ian Allan book on British Locomotive) was an A3 class not A1. Does Hornby know somethig I dont? I know they moved name plates of engines around but A3s were introduced in 1927 and A1s in 1945. 
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,145, 1.0 , Bought as present for my myself!. Excellent well constructed model. Great price and delivered quickly. I believe the Railroad range offers great value for all but the most exacting modeler.
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,146, 1.0 , German Model Train Company in Budget Loco Shocker!Who would have thought it ?This is a great locomotive for kids - top speed is ridiculously fast - but then it is about play value and fun!Running quality is excellent and finish is neat; also nice packagePiko my train puts Hornby Railroad in the shade
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,147, 1.0 , Easy to install either by slotting directly into OO gauge track or by joining wires to holes in the base plate of the signal. Easy to set-up just assign 2x 2 digit accessory addresses from your DCC controller ( Each signal head is commanded independently ) and its ready to use. Full instructions included along with a ladder & sign plate to add even more realism if you so wish.  I have the Hornby E-link & Railmaster system and these work perfectly with it. Other types of signal are also available with single heads distant & Home types. The real benefit of these signals is that because they are wire-free you can move them on your lay-out quickly if you change your mind or layout so worth the extra cost compared with regular signals. plus they are LED for a long life.
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,148, 3.0 , Not bad. Easy to set up but doesnt always sit too well between tracks so be care with that part of it and you cant twist the lights round to face the other direction otherwise its great. 
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,149, 5.0 , Grsat priduct and easy to programme
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,150, 5.0 , yes would recommend it and according to the recipients wish buy it again perhaps another model
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,151, 5.0 , Lovely little engine my son loves it goes very well he is chuffed to bits with it. Swift delivery before estimated date of arrival. Great value for money. 
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,152, 5.0 , Good price even with postage. Cheaper than mending my old engine! Arrived earlier than expected. 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,153, 5.0 , Arrived before actual delivery date and what I expected so great service. Thank you 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,154, 4.0 , Great Xmas present for son loves it ! 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,155, 5.0 , Adorable little train. 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,156, 5.0 , great wee engine 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,157, 5.0 , My Grandson said he didnt like it - he just loved it and it was his favourite Birthday present this year. 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,158, 1.0 , Ordered before Christmas and received it spent Jan building track gave train to my son and it does not work.Found out today I cannot return....
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,159, 5.0 , My son will love this. Ime very pleased with it it looks fab. I also bought the extension pack B to go with it. I know i wont see my son all day  on christmas day 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,160, 5.0 , My Young Grandson was over the moon to receive his first train set The Pennine Express. It is an ideal starter kit with lots of extensions to build it up into a very interesting set.Already he is up to extension Track Pack C !!We are all running out of money after Xmas and his birthday is coming  LOL 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,161, 1.0 , Excellent set. Excellent value. I was particularly attracted having lived as a child overlooking one of the Trans-Pennine routes and very much enjoyed watching the trains.
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,162, 5.0 , it is a hornby uncoupling ramp.took a few sessions to master shunting but all good fun in the endi recommend to you stick one of these at the beginning of sidings or near to junctions for convenience 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,163, 4.0 , four gold again they cry and again i say it does what it says on the pack another worth while and well made product to add to your ever expanding layout again its made to a very and engineered high standard indeed highly recommended i am off to uncouple a couple of trucks so without further delay i will say good bye for now 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,164, 4.0 , Purchased my son his first Hornby train set last year he purchased these sets himself to increase the fun - good value 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,165, 2.0 , Not a lot of use if you are looking for a new uncoupling system - did not realise that what looks like and operating lever is just a position marker 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,166, 5.0 , Purchased for use on my model railway outfit and does exactly what it says on the box
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,167, 1.0 , Just the job. Reasonable & quick delivery. Thank you for the quick service. Got no more to say. Why do I have to add to my first comment? its a waste of time
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,168, 4.0 , works great with Hornby engines 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,210, 5.0 , nice 2 see smoke again
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,170, 5.0 , Fab items !
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,171, 5.0 , the cleaning wagon did everything I required it to do much better than I expected it hovered a lot of fluff & dust 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,172, 4.0 , Was bought this for Christmas.Ideal for cleaning track you cant reach.I have heard it derails on Peco pointswhich my one does.On close inspection I noted the pins on the point rodding sit above track level and catch the buffing/polishing wheel(these can be cut level with the track).The reason for four stars iswhen I used the Dapol track cleaning fluid it broke down the adhesive holding the pads to the spinning discsletting them fall off. 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,173, 4.0 , Good hover but abrasive pad and polish pad not so good 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,174, 5.0 , It does exactly as it states on the box - good value. Caution: make sure that your ballast is glued in place!
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,175, 5.0 , Good little train set something different to the normal with having a crane.The crane is the normal Hornby Breakdown crane which you can get in a steam era rusty colour or modern painted yellow.  This one is red with a British Rail symbol on the side (like from the 1980s). Of course that doesnt match with steam train (a few decades out!); but this being a beginners train set that wont matter most young children (just be careful if your recipient is very clued up on these things!). The crane is weighted so it wont tip over when used to lift derailled trucks and wagons.  Add on winders are plugged in to operate the hook and crane height. Excellent pulley mechanism for raising the crane arm.The train has a plain colour scheme like a general shunting train as if it were one of many of the same kind. Almost gave it 4 stars because of this but its low priced so it stays at 5.The controller track wagon are all the usual good Hornby quality.Excellent small starter trainset especially if you want to do more than just watch a train go round and round..... 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,176, 5.0 , Great amount of track high quality crane and boxcar.lovely little loco its not a pocket rocket it runs at a really nice speed for its size its not a Mallard but its still one of my favourite locos I own(You can tell somethings good when a teenager gives 5 stars) 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,177, 4.0 , Nice starter set - has the standard basic oval and Track Pack one track and a midi mat. The mat is paper so not really durable for using over and over again unless you build a baseboard.The locomotive is a little under powered for the wagons - you need to be quite gentle setting off to prevent slipping and the crane is quite hard to position on the rails so maybe not the best for younger children who might get frustrated with.The detail on the engine is quite basic - if you like realism a bit of weathering may be good to make it look a bit better. The crane is lovely and nicely detailed. 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,178, 5.0 , Present for My Son looks simple and different His first train set and a fair price
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,179, 5.0 , Took a little time to work out the instructions which were in Japanese but now working well and a great item.
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,180, 5.0 , This is an excellent signal kit. Simple to build and works very well
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,181, 5.0 , Kato - made in Japan. Top quality N-gauge chassis. Picks up on all 8 wheels drives through 4 wheels on one bogie. This is useful as its easy to shorten or lengthen the chassis to suit. I am using it under a 009 diesel kit and have had to shorten it by about 3mm to suit. This was quite easy and much easier than most 8 wheel drive chassis. The chassis itself is an excellent and smooth runner. Gaugemaster deliver well packaged and promptly. 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,182, 5.0 , An excellent little motor unit for the railway on my model pier. It runs very smoothly on two AA batteries at a suitable speed. I just have to build a tram body around it that looks authentic for the surroundings. I have also ordered a four-wheel version. 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,183, 5.0 , Useful 4 axle chassis for N or OO9 gauge scratchbuilding trams etc. Can be adapted to fit Yesteryear and TyPhoo trams. Very smooth running good at low speeds.
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,184, 4.0 , I dont own any of Heljans 47 but I find these Bachmanns (Diamond Jubilee is one of three recent additions) to be a huge improvement on the now ageing Lima models but certainly worth the additional cost.
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,185, 5.0 , The  Mak G 1206 locomotives are my some of my favorites. These Piko locomotives I believe that are the best of all the company! Dont expect the high quality of Marklin or Trix Mak G 1206s but the Piko Expert locomotives of this class are wonderful. You can also make from simple DC to DCC or DCC Sound! Piko has found the right way for train modellbahn!!!
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,186, 4.0 , This is an excellent kit that has been around for more than fifty years . Detail is not what would be expected these days - the heavily applied boiler bands and handrails  detract from an otherwise accurate kit . These faults can  however  be rectified with care and despite this  the basic kit has been the basis over the years for countless  motorised  working  models . Not only can the kit be used to build a GWR City class loco but determined kitbashers can use it as the basis for several broadly similar GWR classes from the early years of the twentieth century . Recommended for those prepared to invest the effort . 
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,187, 4.0 , Its a good plastic kit and is fun to make. Downside is that because it comes in a plastic bag instead of a box some of the parts are a little bit bent out of shape because of this. 
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,210, 5.0 , This particular model kit has its origins a half-century ago. and people have converted them with a lot of skilled work to run on OO-gauge model railways. As a static model it needs careful work. It will reward extra effort. This isnt for the beginner. It has to lose a star because the manufacturing standards have improved. A modern kit could be so much better. But one day there just wont be any more of this model.
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,189, 5.0 , Just what I was looking for
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,190, 5.0 , These are really nice quality HO coaches and lightweight too so you can pull quite a number behind even the smallest loco.I bought several for branch line operation and they certainly add inpact to the layout.
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,191, 5.0 , great
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,192, 5.0 , True to product discription 
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,193, 2.0 , Much smaller than thought. 
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,194, 5.0 , charming little train
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,195, 4.0 , Just built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators (which can be glued inside the roof) the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I dont agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in. (They cant go in first) Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point with the windows correctly in place the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body (upside down with the metal weight located). The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesnt lift and drop as freely as it should now. Its on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order (without feeling I was going to break something) that Ive docked a star.
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,196, 5.0 , I received this lovely train today and I am really happy with this purchase. I am not a collector but this is a gift for my father in law and I am sure he is going to love it. It is really well packaged comes in its corgi box. Inside this box is a hardened case and the train is secured in it. The attention to detail is fantastic. It is in perfect condition and I am sure that this will make a lovely addition to anyones collection. I really like the stories behind these trains and choosing of the name. It arrived really well packaged and very fast4 days early in fact.  Great buy. May turn me into a collector yet! 
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,197, 5.0 , Well made and highly detailed model 
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,210, 5.0 , VERY GOOD AND ACCURATE MODEL OF THE DAYS OF STEAM. WELL DONE. Fits perfectly in my display cabinet with the other
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,199, 5.0 , Happy with this purchase for our 4 year old grandson who is trainset mad.
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,200, 5.0 , Excellent engine arrived a day earlier than expected extremely well wrapped. New and about £10 less than the list price. Just had a test both ways on my layout runs brilliantly- thanks guys. 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,201, 5.0 , My son was very pleased with the product
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,202, 5.0 , Arrived in good time. All good and works well. Son is very happy. Thank you.
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,203, 5.0 , So cheap but an excellent product. At this price any bulb failures experienced after switch on are no problem - just re-order some more. Arrived on time and were well packed. I dont know how this level of authenticity can be available at such a low price. 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,204, 5.0 , The item was excellent but the scale was 1/100 I would have preferred 1/76 scale. Some information of how to set up the lighting system would have been helpful ie. the size of transformer required for the no of lights being used in parallel or in series 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,205, 5.0 , the single head lamppost lamps complimented the double head lamppost purchased to complete the trainset layout 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,206, 5.0 , These are great so bright and value for money
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,207, 5.0 , These ex-LNER Gresley teak-bodied buffet cars built in the 1930s survived long enough to receive all three British Railways coach liveries crimson and cream maroon (in which this model is also currently available) and finally the blue and grey depicted here used from the mid-1960s.  Ive given this one 5* as opposed to the maroon ones 4* as in my opinion it looks much better in this blue and grey livery.  The reviews are virtually the same apart from that rating.  Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build. Its stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E whilst the one depicted here E9131E lasted only until 1974.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and whilst a scale person wouldnt fit into the gap between the seats and tables you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail. Its a lovely little bar/counter complete with chrome edging an (empty) transparent sandwich display case what looks like a chrome coffee-maker and one of those metal foot-rests running the length of the bar/counter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level. No stools though presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches over-priced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hard-earned.Theres also a representation of the hand-rails at the windows by the buffet bar/counter to hold onto going over the points at junctions (or after a few expensive tinnies (which is all they used to have (and still do as far as Im aware) in the beers department.Read more › 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,208, 5.0 , Fantastic.
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,210, 5.0 , My first venture into Hornbys new TTS system - I only have a basic Bachmann E-Z controller which can only provide functions 1 to 9 which work ok - I have no idea what functions 10 to 18 do - very frustrating.  All the mags have tested TTS so no need for me to comment - the chuff is too loud in my book but otherwise Im very pleased indeed with my purchase...
Joana,Waldie,7/6/1986,210, 5.0 , Top notch train with sound as good as the Bachman version. 
Joana,Waldie,7/6/1986,211, 5.0 , Typical Hornby quality especially with their own sound chip which probably knocks over £120 off having to have one fitted. 
Joana,Waldie,7/6/1986,212, 4.0 , Looks great well packaged and arrived quickly..what more do I want
