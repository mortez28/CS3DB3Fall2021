Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,1, 4.0 , Part of the magic for me growing up as a boy was to buy (or be given) the new Hornby catalogue every year even if it included 90% of the same products as the previous year.  Ive still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,2, 5.0 , Amazing detail every credit to the photographer in this book a worthy reference manual as well as a sales brochure. even if you only have a passing interest in the hobby you will be transported to another time when we were all younger and in awe of the big trains. 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,3, 5.0 , This was purchased on behalf of my Dad. He is always asking me to look up 00 gauge engines online so this has been a good buy as he can look at it anytime. Would definitely buy the next one 2015!It arrived quickly and in perfect condition :-) 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,4, 5.0 , Everything I really needed to see what was on offer from Hornby in the way of trains.  Would not have minded it included an RRP as well though 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,5, 5.0 , I collect them all as the glossy pictures are great and it is nice that you can still get catalogs to collect. 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,6, 5.0 , What a great book.  Extremely useful insight to all future christmas presents. 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,7, 5.0 , Useful info for someonelike me starting back into the hobby after many years 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,8, 5.0 , A well produced very good quality catalogue.Super quality pictures.
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,9, 4.0 , Very happy with the communication with funkybuys 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,10, 5.0 , Great buy.
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,11, 5.0 , Simple & GREAT FUN for 5+My nephews face was amazing when he opened this for his birthday!! His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke it literally did!)Its very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble it takes 2 mins. Its very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if theyre very interested in trains. This gets them started in the hobby and doesnt cost much at all! 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,12, 5.0 , Excellent product everybody should have one or to of product  excellent  100 percent ok speedy delivery excellent i give it five stars CLASSIC TOY TRAIN SET TRACK CARRIAGES LIGHT ENGINE BOXED BOYS KIDS BATTERYdouble aa battery goes in top of engine 
Ethelbert,Retallick,1/13/2003,13, 5.0 , I was extremely pleased with the train set really good value for money. 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,14, 1.0 , i found this item not suitable for young children  very difficult to keep the carriages together and the whole thing kept coming off the track.All very thin plastic. I would not recommend this item. 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,15, 1.0 , The Train did not work  and as it was a present for my young nephew for Christmas I was very disappointed but as it was only £7 it was not worth the fuss of ordering another 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,16, 4.0 , Better than expected. It has a proper oval of track rather than just a circle. My 2 year old grandsn loves it although he finds it difficult to put on the track. 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,17, 5.0 , Brilliant little train.  Bought for my son who was looking for a train that looks like the polar express - he was not disappointed.  Great value. 
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,18, 3.0 , train carriages kept falling track  of and the connectors not good. better on the floor
Raddie,Moxson,7/15/1985,19, 5.0 , I love it. Perfect with the earlier ordered locomotive.Again: I would recommend it to the masters of the topic. Its not just a toy.
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,20, 5.0 , Bought this for my Grandsons birthday.  He is currently collecting some bits for his train set.  Keeps him away from the TV and computers.  So think it was well worth it. 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,21, 4.0 , only four this time i here you say but i still highly recommend this product as it is a very well engineered piece of equipment and a very worth while addition to every railway enthusiasts collection young or old alike even those who are just starting out this is a good place to get started she also has the lines (a good body) she is neat sweet and petite she also came well boxed and securely wrapped she also came in on time and delivered by courteous gentleman  again many thanks 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,22, 5.0 , A beautiful little model engine of years gone by.
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,23, 5.0 , the victorian style added to the character that my husband was trying to acheve with his model train layout 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,24, 5.0 , Good value
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,25, 5.0 , High standard model well worth the wait.  Replaces a model of a Utility Van that has been in production by Triang and Hornby since the 1950s! 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,26, 4.0 , This a good wagon - thanks
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,27, 5.0 , This has gone down very well this Christmas. Adults and kids collectively enjoy its appearance from around the Christmas tree.Whilst I use this as effectively a Christmas tree decoration it is nevertheless a quality Hornby OO gauge model in its own right and could be used year round for a modelling enthusiast.A word of warning would be that the model is delicate and intricate. If you have cats for example they are sure to damage the delicate parts as they seek to derail the train from the track. 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,28, 5.0 , My 1st Hornby and I absolutely love it. It will look amazing under my Christmas Tree this year too. Takes minutes to set up and works great. Smooth quiet and fantastic. 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,29, 5.0 , Excellent value for money and fits around the base of most Christmas trees. My little boy loved it!! 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,30, 5.0 , Perfect Christmas present for the big kid ordered as a Christmas gift for my dad he loves trains. It arrived on time and looks great. 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,31, 5.0 , As Usual top quality Hornby quality lovely cute set which kids of all ages will adore 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,32, 5.0 , This was a fantastic item and has finally made my Christmas village scene for all to enjoy. Thank you very much. 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,33, 5.0 , Great price arrived in good time packaged well appears to be new and original presentation of train package looks good the train looks fab (realistic) and works well.  My little boy was thrilled...  Pity it didnt make any sounds... 
Lilli,Amberger,3/17/1993,34, 1.0 , Really disappointed - train worked twice and then power unit stopped working just in time for Christmas. Son was really excited but the whole controller unit felt flimsy which seems to have been proved by its decision to conk out.
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,35, 5.0 , Xmas box for grandsonam sure it will be great
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,36, 4.0 , We bought this (and 2 others)for our grandsons and they love them. They now have about 7 and it can get a bit noisy if they decide to press the buttons on all of them at once. they are only 3 and 18 months at the moment and dont play unsupervised! 
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,37, 4.0 , This product was a gift for my nephew and he is enjoying playing with it with all the other chuggington interactive trains he got for christmas and so far it is doing everything we expected it to. 
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,38, 5.0 , We all loved these chugginton trains and have fun getting them to talk to each other.  My grandson now has six of them and takes them to bed with him. 
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,39, 5.0 , This is a great addition to the interactive train set all the trains interact with each other. My daughter gets hours of play out of them!
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,40, 5.0 , Grandson loved it. Hauls good load
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,41, 5.0 , Very good product. Thank you.
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,42, 5.0 , very good
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,43, 5.0 , Beautiful model If your a fan of the G.W.R this loco is a must have Just that. 
Wells,Bramall,5/1/1956,44, 5.0 , Christmas gift for him in doors he will love it 
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,45, 5.0 , runs very smooth good model
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,46, 5.0 , Great quality lots of detail run nic and smooth great little engine
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,47, 5.0 , Fantastic little set beautifully made and a decent price.
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,48, 4.0 , The product is as expected.  The only worry is it looks like the connections will easily break - not robust 
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,49, 5.0 , Very happy with product
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,50, 3.0 , My 2 year old loves chuggington so we decided to get her this set. To be fair i dont think there is much longevity with it and after a while my daughter played with the train itself rather than the train and track although it does still come out now and again. I had read some reviews that you have to keep building the track as it comes apart easily. I think that depends on if your child is heavy handed or not i havent had to keep putting it back together but i could see that if a child was a bit heavy handed then you would be up and down all the time. I have taught my 2 year old to try and put it back together on her own and she can mangae to do some bits but does force them together if they are round the wrong way but time will cure that. Overall yes im glad i got it for her and i dont regret buying it there are better products out there or might be just worth getting them the trains on there own. 
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,51, 5.0 , We have a lot of fun time with my son with this series. It also helps imagination and construction skills as he is building a different rail root every day
Katherine,Rodenhurst,9/11/1973,52, 4.0 , Lovely quality from Kato.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,53, 5.0 , I NOW HAVE A SECOND OF THESE BACHMANN POWERHAULS COMING AS THEY CAN TAKE REAL TRAINS BETWEEN 20-30 WAGONSOF A HEAVY WEIGHT.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,54, 5.0 , This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a white enclosed coach with a pair of white horses and two figures on the (red) driving seat dressed in a grey livery. One is a man in a grey greatcoat and top hat the other is a female in a grey coat or uniform jacket and grey jockey-style of cap. There do not appear to be figures inside but if you look through the back window these are heads visible. This is a striking model and would be an excellent decoration for almost any diorama.As you would expect from Preiser these figures are of a high quality of manufacture detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £20 for my set so it pays to shop around in your local model shops – or even a distant one. I live in London but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,55, 5.0 , This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a long wooden wagon bearing a very long barrel or wooden cylinder with two horses hauling it and a driver seated on a driving bench. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser these figures are of a high quality of manufacture detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £20 for my set so it pays to shop around in your local model shops – or even a distant one. I live in London but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,56, 5.0 , Beautiful little model which I wholeheartedly reccommend.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,57, 5.0 , A nice little train for our layout and a change. Up to the usual Takara Tomy high standard. The little front light is not that bright but looks OK.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,58, 5.0 , Excellent model in perfect condition from reputeable amazon seller however it was returned for a refund because its couplings were not compatable with my other Railjet coaches. I was previously ignorant of the fact that Roco Railjet coaches with internal lighting do not have the same couplings as those without. Roco Railjet coaches 64722 / 64723 / 64724 have internal lighting powered through connections in the couplings.
Gun,Casewell,9/3/2014,59, 5.0 , Got these for my 2 yr old - hes obsessed with trains and loves these characters. They are pretty tough so have survived some bashing. Only thing is that he cant get them to attach to each other with the ball/ socket joint its a bit fiddly so I have to help with that (repeatedly as they do come apart quite easily!) However this wont be an issue as he gets older. Only got Brewster and Wilson this time to see how he got on but think I will be getting the track and Koko for xmas as he plays with these for ages and loves talking to them (not sure he realises the trains talk to each other he just thinks they talk to him... could be setting myself up for years of counselling with that :) 
Cosette,Sumpter,8/17/2002,60, 5.0 , I bought the whole set of chuggington interactive trains and train set for my grandsons to play with when they come to visit which is only twice a year as they live in Italy.  I think I have had more fun with them listening to them speak to each other I am absolutely fascinated with them. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,61, 2.0 , The toy is much larger than other Chugginton toys and doesnt fit on any of the Chuggington rail tracks. Cue disappointed 3 year old. I think this should have been clearer from the description of the toy.Otherwise it works fine and is as described. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,62, 5.0 , I purchased this as well as old Puffer Pete and extra track too for my little 2 year old grandson and he and Daddy love it ..Perfect well made and delivered fast too. 5 stars for a 1st class product and seller too. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,63, 4.0 , My 4yr old loves these trains. They are fun when they talk to each other & helps to build up an interactive imaginative game. Not the most robust of toys but fine for kids who dont play too roughly! 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,64, 5.0 , I bought this for my son who has a Chuggington train set and its definitely worth having at least 2trains to interact with each other. It took his enjoyment of the track to another level. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,65, 4.0 , Bought for our 2 yr old twin boys to build up their collection great interactive toy and works well with the other Chugginton characters we have. Fast delivery also 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,66, 5.0 , Good size very sturdy and well made. The interaction between the trains is very good. Not easy to break very easy to couple the trains together. Great product
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,67, 5.0 , We love Tomica!
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,68, 5.0 , It seems as though we are gradually purchasing all of the die cast trains for our 3 year old to play with on his Take Along & Take N Play track. Got this one for his birthday; Molly being yellow was great as this is my sons favourite colour. He spends hours making different tracks and then playing with the trains making up stories. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,69, 5.0 , my boy and girl love molly. especially my 14 month old daughter - seems to have really taken to this yellow engine! good product and great delivery. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,70, 5.0 , My son has a large collection of his trains and they are fantastic well worth the money! Only downside the paint scratches easily. 
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,71, 5.0 , My grandchildren loved Molly I thought she was well made and very pretty. A very nice addition to there Thomas collection.
Ciel,Pinyon,4/25/1943,72, 4.0 , Have to say that this is a lovely itemif a tad expensivebut still a little gem.I managed to get mine at a bargain pricebut if you can too then it is well worth having.My biggest incentive in buying this was to be able to add two extra wooden/teak ex-LNER coaches to the three I already have from the Rare Bird set from the Barry J Freeman range.Those three teaks are very difficult to add todue to most coaches being LNER & not BR.This set means you can have a rake of five!The detail on them is utterly sublime & they are stunninga tenfold better than the teaks in the railroad range.If only they made a BR-numbered buffet car!As for the lovely black British Railways N2 tank loco-well that too is a lovely itemgreat little runner & puller.Only drawback is that the locomotive is not digitally/DCC ready as far as I gather.Not VFM if you consider how much is being outlaid.It comes with a numbered certificate & very attractively decorative box......I give it an eight out of tenwith marks lost on cost & the lack of an easy to fit DCC socket... 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,73, 4.0 , Hornby R2981 London 1948 train pack with Class N2 BR ex-LNER Brake Composite coach & ex-LNER Full 3rd coach. Olympics Limited Edition. Another beautiful limited edition from Hornby that is an excellent detailed train pack for use or collection : 00 gauge : Individually numbered certificate the official product of London 2012. Class N2 - Motor: 5 pole Skew wound - DCC ready : Pristine finish : Special Features : Sprung buffers Extensive Detail NEM couplings. Shop around for the best price as these have been reduced by Hornby to half price sale some months ago. 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,74, 4.0 , Whilst the purists complain that this is not an entirely accurate 1948 train (the locomotive was apparently based in Scotland and did not have remote control systems fitted as the model has) it is a great souvenir and the coaches are of extraordinary quality. I suspect it will be a good investment better than any bank at the moment and better made than most Olympic memorabilia 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,75, 5.0 , The carriages - what can I say - I would suspect the best ready to run ever made - the challenge of the teak effect completely mastered plus absurd levels of detail
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,76, 5.0 , it was as advertised and delivered promptly 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,77, 5.0 , Easy to wire looks great on the layout. 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,78, 4.0 , Very satisfied thank you 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,79, 5.0 , thank you / 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,80, 5.0 , Lol
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,81, 5.0 , Great product for the price of the TTS sound Im very impressed
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,82, 5.0 , Elizabeth is a very feisty truck who stands no nonsense from a lot of silly trains. A great addition to the collection 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,83, 5.0 , My three year old boy absolutely loved this! Very sturdy design - ideal for small children to play with. Brilliant! 
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,84, 5.0 , My Son Loved the series and the Take Along Vehicles.
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,85, 4.0 , This was a present for my brother.  He said it is brilliant and has enjoyed making it. The service I received was good and although it took a little while to arrive it was worth the wait.
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,86, 5.0 , I found no issues with these at all they are great for my son who has sensory issues he walked around everywhere with them bought them after the occupational therapists adviced us we have had them a few weeks now and they still work as good as the day we got them I would highly recommend them.
Leandra,Coulton,7/3/1997,87, 5.0 , An excellent product at an excellent price !! 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,88, 4.0 , Runs well with hornby dcc decoder.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,89, 5.0 , A great addition to the Kato Glacier Express set bringing your train up to a respectable length and it comes in a quality presentation case. Delivery from Japan only takes a couple of weeks. Well worth the money. 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,90, 5.0 , Great value although shipped from Japan arrived in good time.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,91, 4.0 , This is a pretty decent starter set as a first step into model railways.You get a very nice detailed model of the Gloucester City and its tender and three equally well-detailed model coaches. The locomotive is DCC-ready. (DCC is the digital control system for model railways allowing different trains to run at different speeds o the same tracks - DCC-ready indicates that the loco has a socket into which a DCC module can be slotted in future; the controller provided with the set is not DCC-compatible.)As with all Hornby starter sets there is sufficient track included for a simple oval circuit with a single siding and one set of points. Hornby points are a bit flimsy - they dont seem to click as positively into one side or the other as I remember those on the model railways of my youth doing but the track is fine otherwise. The fishplates are reassuringly tight and it all slots together easily. There is also a trackmat supplied which is a rather grand name for a large printed sheet of glossy paper with a suggested layout to make all of which requires you to buy rather a lot of extra track and accessories - more a piece of marketing than anything really useful.The supplied controller is a simple rheostat - you can turn the speed up and down and select forward or reverse but its all you need to get started. (If you get keen you can buy a DCC module for the locomotive and a DCC controller to give more control options for a more sophisticated layout.)Putting it all together took 20 minutes or so - its reasonably obvious how you assemble it all which is fortunate as the supplied instructions are a bit sketchy. Not really a problem as most bits will only fit one way!Read more › 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,92, 4.0 , A typical Hornby starter set. The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it and for a railroad model the detail is very good! The Pullman coaches are equally attractive to look at and feel as though they will last a good while. The track included while a fairly minimal amount is sufficient to get the set moving comfortably. The only downside in my opinion is the controller feels very cheap. I would not expect to see much use from it. However for the fact I am viewing this as simply a test model for something much larger it will not see too much heavy use anyway. The loco runs smoothly and quietly and I cant wait to see it running on a much larger layout! 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,93, 5.0 , Great item as usual from HornbyLoco is well detailed above Hornbys Railroad versions in my opinion.A nice quality set far too good for younger children who would easily damage though a good starter set for the enthusiast. 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,94, 4.0 , This is a lovely set to own and my only serious reservation is that you really need to spend quite a lot more on extras to get the best out of it. As a starting point its great though.The track is good-quality but does need a flat solid base. Youll need to spend time getting the creases out of the supplied 1600x1180mm MidiMat too.The detailing on the locomotive and carriages is pretty good. The conn rods move nicely and you can see inside the carriages with their white `table cloths and gold-coloured lamps. It could be better still but most people will be perfectly happy with it as I am.The box suggests all sorts of further sets to enhance this one. The Basic Oval and Track Pack A (R8221) are included to create an extended oval with a siding. Adding Track Packs B and C (R8222 and R8223) gives you a double oval with siding (but just one pair of points connecting them). D and E (R8224 and R8225) make it really interesting but thats almost £100 so far and you can still add F (R8226) for extra sidings. Oh and youll need a new 1800x1200 TrakMat R8217 to go with packs E and F.Then youll want to add accessories such as stations signal boxes and engine sheds. The message is...dont imagine £150 for this set will be the end of your expenditure!Without at least the extra track the set will be pretty dull unless you just want to go round and round in circles with the occasional foray into the siding. Hence 1 star deducted for fun.Some parts notably some of the couplings seem rather fragile. I wouldnt recommend this set for younger children and would suggest 8 as an absolute minimum and only with a lot of adult supervision. 10 or 12 would be better.Read more › 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,95, 4.0 , This is the railroad version of the Duke of Gloucester which is slightly less detailed than the top of the range model and consequently less fragile. The three Pullman coaches are also from the Railroad range and do not have interior lighting as do the top of the range models. It is a pity that the roofs are silver and a bit flashy they would have been better in grey. Another slight inconvenience is that the couplings do not match. The loco has the newer style couplings and the coaches the wider older style but this does not impede hooking up however. This train set was a real bargain at the price I paid at the time.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,96, 5.0 , Although an ex.LMS Stanier prototype this very simple kit from Dapol makes a good generic non-corridor carriage fairly representive of those produced by the Big Four railway companies prior to nationalisation. Derived from ex.Mainline/Airfix tooling these very straightforward kits are a very attractively priced alternative to the increasingly highly priced ready to run items produced by Hornby and Bachman.
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,97, 4.0 , I have not built the model yet but look forward to doing so in due course I have several of these fairground models i enjoy building them and watching them work 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,98, 5.0 , Faller kits are very good quality and if you follow the instructions to the letter your model will be great.Ive not yet started on these kits as yet but I have done 32 others all Faller as well as 5 other makes.Delivery and packing by this supplier was excellent the prices were keen 5 star dealer. 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,99, 5.0 , GREAT ITEM THANX! 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,100, 5.0 , Perfect
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,101, 5.0 , A heavily built unit of excelent quality and exacting standards. Superior to previous incarnations of standard stock and will haul six carriages with relative ease. 
Lonnard,Hackinge,6/29/1943,102, 5.0 , Excellent value and has brought all my rolling stock to the modern age of Digital the Flying Scotsman locomotive has fantastic detail close up and runs so smooth on the tracks it is is a pleasure to see a age of steam. 
Emmey,Sousa,8/22/1978,103, 4.0 , Beaware...says DCC ready but only works after you buy the separate dcc decoder (currently £16)...Well made trainlovely detail  but we had to wait whilst we ordered the decoder..slightly annoying!...hence 4 star 
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,104, 4.0 , It is a lovely hornby train and maybe someday kids can play with it too hee hee. Best regards. G 
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,105, 5.0 , Really impressed with the detail on this model I have several Hornby models and put them in custom glass cases as static models they really look the part! 
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,106, 5.0 , Bought as present for my husband. He was delighted with it. Good price and delivered quickly. Would recommend to others with model railway interests. 
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,107, 5.0 , Im sure my father will adore his christmas gift. 
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,108, 5.0 , An excellent model very detailed my son actually ended up getting 2 of these for Christmas. The seller wad very understanding and took the product back and issued a full refund without any quibble
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,109, 5.0 , Good buy and good value buy just wot my son wonted a good for model railway across both tracks and easy to assemble no glue needed to put together
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,110, 5.0 , This set arrived on the 27th and was in perfect condition thank you
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,111, 4.0 , grandchildren love itbut it does tend to go round and round a lotdoesnt run well on carpet/rug so need an area thats tiled or laminatedbut well worth the money great value
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,112, 5.0 , This is a finely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways (Epoch 1) baggage/post wagon in the standard epoch 1 green livery with a black roof. It is a bogie vehicle with end vestibule doors and two sliding doors each side with a guards compartment fitted with a `birdcage roof at one end. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows and sliding doors (unfortunately so can one of the screw-fittings for a bogie). The running number is PPu 17660 and there is a destination board for a Munchen to Berlin service.This model is fitted with the standard `loop style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with a transparent plasticky internal tray with side cover.This is a beautifully detailed model as you would expect from Trix and is of a high quality of manufacture. Note that there are other models available to form a rake of the Munch to Berlin coaches.
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,113, 5.0 , An excellent kit of an ex.LMS Stanier non-corridor brake coach that can pass muster as non-corridor stock produced by any of the Big Four railway companies prior to Nationalisation in 1948. Produced from ex.Mainline/Airfix GMR tooling these are simple to assemble kits that are easy to super-detail.
Elianora,Grishanin,9/12/1997,114, 5.0 , Really good service and great product. On time for Christmas :)
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,115, 5.0 , Great addition to the auto city set to give a military air to play.
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,116, 4.0 , I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set. 
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,117, 5.0 , Every child should own a train set and lately Ive started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. (And  if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot thats OK too: I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone whilst building titchy windmills).Its nice to see after not handling  a set since the early 70s that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service with both passenger and freight carriages but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.Its very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game and the price is what it is: Theyve always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally whereas this is on an old style analogue controller which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains etc this  set would have to run on a separate track?So Im really glad i own a trainset again and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump. 
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,118, 4.0 , My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before but it is clearly well thought out very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set it can be oval or circular and thats about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy very classic but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. Its huge to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around £15-£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example but to go up you need to slope very very gradually otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldnt climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space and once you accept it wont slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle (total of 6) as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more ›
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,119, 5.0 , This model is something all BR modellers will want and comes at a very reasonable price for a DCC fitted loco. will definitely recommend it & the seller 
Vallie,Simes,2/4/2005,120, 4.0 , Fantastic model of a locomotive Ive followed from childhood. NYMR had a fabulous variant steaming and its a joy to behold. 
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,121, 5.0 , FANTASTIC DETAIL HAVE NOT RUN IT YET. BUILD LAYOUT PLANS AT THE AT THIS TIME.
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,122, 5.0 , i am over the moon with this item exemplary service and fantastic value for the item
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,123, 5.0 , Fantastic lamps at a very fair price
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,124, 5.0 , This is a nicely-detailed HO-scale model of a Saxon Sate Railways (Epoch 1) 1st/2nd class express bogie coach - type ABBu - in the standard epoch 1 dark green livery with a light grey roof. This is a very modern style of wooden-framed steel panelled side-corridor coach with a steel chassis and end-vestibule entrances and `concertina connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows such as the partitions and seating and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is 103.This model is fitted with the standard `loop style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Piko card box with a transparent window and a transparent plastic side-opening tray inside.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture with a small packet of delicate bits for you to add. There are other models available to form a rake of these coaches.Note that I paid £37 for my model when new so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops - or even a distant one. I live in London but find it worth hopping on a train to Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,125, 4.0 , Its a power brick what more can be said? This though was the cheapest source for a non to cheap necessity - why it wasnt bundled I dont know! 
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,126, 4.0 , At first I thought it was not for the intended job but was advised that it was working as expected and was doing the job as required so it is a good price and very compact 
Anetta,MacKay,8/19/2017,127, 5.0 , Works well as expected. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,128, 5.0 , as described 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,129, 5.0 , Just what I wanted
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,130, 5.0 , Top Spin is a very popular fairground/themepark ride seen under different names. I bought this kit to replace my worn out model built about eight years ago as part of my model fairground which I used to exhibit to raise funds for coronary research and childrens CHUF unit at the Freeman Hospital. Much care is required in building these kits to get the best results theyre fun to build and a delight to run. The quality is excellent and instructions concise. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,131, 4.0 , Very good
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,132, 4.0 , This is an excellent addition to any diecast collection and a must for Harry Potter fans. Looks great in its box. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,133, 5.0 , This is a very good quality train. Not one to be played with but defiantly a collectors item for the future. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,134, 5.0 , A great addition to my sons collection well constructed great design and attention to detail.  A great buy for any Harry Potter fan. 
Prescott,Paolicchi,11/21/1984,135, 5.0 , Toy was brought as a joke present for my father in law. He is Harry Potter obsessed and he enjoyed this gift very much. It is of good durability and looks very authentic.
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,136, 5.0 , Thanks very well made L&YR 2-4-2 Tank by Bachmann .
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,137, 5.0 , Keeps my husband happy. Well impressed
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,138, 5.0 , I have recently decided to rebuild my model railway after many years being stored in a box.  I needed a controller and decided that a Gaugemaster was a good choice.  As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didnt take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.  I have been using this controller for several weeks now and I am still very pleased with it. 
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,139, 4.0 , Next day free delivery! Very small fits easily in the palm of my hand. Screw terminals for the outputs and plug in supply from the transformer input. Very smooth control of locos.Would have preferred the connections on the bottom of the unit for ease of handling. 
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,140, 5.0 , very happy with my product. works great
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,141, 5.0 , Very good kit goes together very well.
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,142, 5.0 , Walthers Proto F7a locomotive is everything you would expect from this range.  Beautiful prototypical details smoothest running qualities and of course the sounds!  Awesome loco in fantastic packaging - it aint cheap but therein lies the truth.  You can go and buy a Bachmann F7a - and theyre great - but this has the hand rails and that extra feel of a quality product.  Some say that Athearn Genesis are the best - but this is a truly wonderful model that gets prominent place in my F7 collection
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,143, 5.0 , Brilliant! The joy on his face was the picture of Christmas! His reaction when the sound of coal shovelling was heard followed by the toot toot as the train started followed by slow but progressively faster motion of the steam train as it moves left my little boy speechless! A Christmas memory the I will never forget and according to him: my best present ever!Jorge 
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,144, 4.0 , It arrived late this afternoon. Looks gorgeous. However the Flying Scotsman named engine (60103 according to my 1957 abc Ian Allan book on British Locomotive) was an A3 class not A1. Does Hornby know somethig I dont? I know they moved name plates of engines around but A3s were introduced in 1927 and A1s in 1945. 
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,145, 5.0 , Bought as present for my myself!. Excellent well constructed model. Great price and delivered quickly. I believe the Railroad range offers great value for all but the most exacting modeler.
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,146, 5.0 , German Model Train Company in Budget Loco Shocker!Who would have thought it ?This is a great locomotive for kids - top speed is ridiculously fast - but then it is about play value and fun!Running quality is excellent and finish is neat; also nice packagePiko my train puts Hornby Railroad in the shade
Chaddie,Suffe,5/17/2004,147, 5.0 , Easy to install either by slotting directly into OO gauge track or by joining wires to holes in the base plate of the signal. Easy to set-up just assign 2x 2 digit accessory addresses from your DCC controller ( Each signal head is commanded independently ) and its ready to use. Full instructions included along with a ladder & sign plate to add even more realism if you so wish.  I have the Hornby E-link & Railmaster system and these work perfectly with it. Other types of signal are also available with single heads distant & Home types. The real benefit of these signals is that because they are wire-free you can move them on your lay-out quickly if you change your mind or layout so worth the extra cost compared with regular signals. plus they are LED for a long life. 
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,148, 3.0 , Not bad. Easy to set up but doesnt always sit too well between tracks so be care with that part of it and you cant twist the lights round to face the other direction otherwise its great. 
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,149, 5.0 , Grsat priduct and easy to programme
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,150, 5.0 , yes would recommend it and according to the recipients wish buy it again perhaps another model
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,151, 5.0 , Lovely little engine my son loves it goes very well he is chuffed to bits with it. Swift delivery before estimated date of arrival. Great value for money. 
Dov,Goudy,8/16/1975,152, 5.0 , Good price even with postage. Cheaper than mending my old engine! Arrived earlier than expected. 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,153, 5.0 , Arrived before actual delivery date and what I expected so great service. Thank you 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,154, 4.0 , Great Xmas present for son loves it ! 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,155, 5.0 , Adorable little train. 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,156, 5.0 , great wee engine 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,157, 5.0 , My Grandson said he didnt like it - he just loved it and it was his favourite Birthday present this year. 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,158, 1.0 , Ordered before Christmas and received it spent Jan building track gave train to my son and it does not work.Found out today I cannot return....
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,159, 5.0 , My son will love this. Ime very pleased with it it looks fab. I also bought the extension pack B to go with it. I know i wont see my son all day  on christmas day 
Shelli,Rodgman,2/22/2005,160, 5.0 , My Young Grandson was over the moon to receive his first train set The Pennine Express. It is an ideal starter kit with lots of extensions to build it up into a very interesting set.Already he is up to extension Track Pack C !!We are all running out of money after Xmas and his birthday is coming  LOL 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,161, 5.0 , Excellent set. Excellent value. I was particularly attracted having lived as a child overlooking one of the Trans-Pennine routes and very much enjoyed watching the trains.
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,162, 5.0 , it is a hornby uncoupling ramp.took a few sessions to master shunting but all good fun in the endi recommend to you stick one of these at the beginning of sidings or near to junctions for convenience 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,163, 4.0 , four gold again they cry and again i say it does what it says on the pack another worth while and well made product to add to your ever expanding layout again its made to a very and engineered high standard indeed highly recommended i am off to uncouple a couple of trucks so without further delay i will say good bye for now 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,164, 4.0 , Purchased my son his first Hornby train set last year he purchased these sets himself to increase the fun - good value 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,165, 2.0 , Not a lot of use if you are looking for a new uncoupling system - did not realise that what looks like and operating lever is just a position marker 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,166, 5.0 , Purchased for use on my model railway outfit and does exactly what it says on the box
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,167, 5.0 , Just the job. Reasonable & quick delivery. Thank you for the quick service. Got no more to say. Why do I have to add to my first comment? its a waste of time 
Waldo,Elcombe,7/3/1986,168, 4.0 , works great with Hornby engines 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,169, 5.0 , nice 2 see smoke again
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,170, 5.0 , Fab items !
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,171, 5.0 , the cleaning wagon did everything I required it to do much better than I expected it hovered a lot of fluff & dust 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,172, 4.0 , Was bought this for Christmas.Ideal for cleaning track you cant reach.I have heard it derails on Peco pointswhich my one does.On close inspection I noted the pins on the point rodding sit above track level and catch the buffing/polishing wheel(these can be cut level with the track).The reason for four stars iswhen I used the Dapol track cleaning fluid it broke down the adhesive holding the pads to the spinning discsletting them fall off. 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,173, 4.0 , Good hover but abrasive pad and polish pad not so good 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,174, 5.0 , It does exactly as it states on the box - good value. Caution: make sure that your ballast is glued in place!
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,175, 5.0 , Good little train set something different to the normal with having a crane.The crane is the normal Hornby Breakdown crane which you can get in a steam era rusty colour or modern painted yellow.  This one is red with a British Rail symbol on the side (like from the 1980s). Of course that doesnt match with steam train (a few decades out!); but this being a beginners train set that wont matter most young children (just be careful if your recipient is very clued up on these things!). The crane is weighted so it wont tip over when used to lift derailled trucks and wagons.  Add on winders are plugged in to operate the hook and crane height. Excellent pulley mechanism for raising the crane arm.The train has a plain colour scheme like a general shunting train as if it were one of many of the same kind. Almost gave it 4 stars because of this but its low priced so it stays at 5.The controller track wagon are all the usual good Hornby quality.Excellent small starter trainset especially if you want to do more than just watch a train go round and round..... 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,176, 5.0 , Great amount of track high quality crane and boxcar.lovely little loco its not a pocket rocket it runs at a really nice speed for its size its not a Mallard but its still one of my favourite locos I own(You can tell somethings good when a teenager gives 5 stars) 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,177, 4.0 , Nice starter set - has the standard basic oval and Track Pack one track and a midi mat. The mat is paper so not really durable for using over and over again unless you build a baseboard.The locomotive is a little under powered for the wagons - you need to be quite gentle setting off to prevent slipping and the crane is quite hard to position on the rails so maybe not the best for younger children who might get frustrated with.The detail on the engine is quite basic - if you like realism a bit of weathering may be good to make it look a bit better. The crane is lovely and nicely detailed. 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,178, 5.0 , Present for My Son looks simple and different His first train set and a fair price
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,179, 5.0 , Took a little time to work out the instructions which were in Japanese but now working well and a great item.
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,180, 5.0 , This is an excellent signal kit. Simple to build and works very well
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,181, 5.0 , Kato - made in Japan. Top quality N-gauge chassis. Picks up on all 8 wheels drives through 4 wheels on one bogie. This is useful as its easy to shorten or lengthen the chassis to suit. I am using it under a 009 diesel kit and have had to shorten it by about 3mm to suit. This was quite easy and much easier than most 8 wheel drive chassis. The chassis itself is an excellent and smooth runner. Gaugemaster deliver well packaged and promptly. 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,182, 5.0 , An excellent little motor unit for the railway on my model pier. It runs very smoothly on two AA batteries at a suitable speed. I just have to build a tram body around it that looks authentic for the surroundings. I have also ordered a four-wheel version. 
Giuseppe,Pashbee,6/16/1994,183, 5.0 , Useful 4 axle chassis for N or OO9 gauge scratchbuilding trams etc. Can be adapted to fit Yesteryear and TyPhoo trams. Very smooth running good at low speeds.
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,184, 4.0 , I dont own any of Heljans 47 but I find these Bachmanns (Diamond Jubilee is one of three recent additions) to be a huge improvement on the now ageing Lima models but certainly worth the additional cost.
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,185, 5.0 , The  Mak G 1206 locomotives are my some of my favorites. These Piko locomotives I believe that are the best of all the company! Dont expect the high quality of Marklin or Trix Mak G 1206s but the Piko Expert locomotives of this class are wonderful. You can also make from simple DC to DCC or DCC Sound! Piko has found the right way for train modellbahn!!!
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,186, 4.0 , This is an excellent kit that has been around for more than fifty years . Detail is not what would be expected these days - the heavily applied boiler bands and handrails  detract from an otherwise accurate kit . These faults can  however  be rectified with care and despite this  the basic kit has been the basis over the years for countless  motorised  working  models . Not only can the kit be used to build a GWR City class loco but determined kitbashers can use it as the basis for several broadly similar GWR classes from the early years of the twentieth century . Recommended for those prepared to invest the effort . 
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,187, 4.0 , Its a good plastic kit and is fun to make. Downside is that because it comes in a plastic bag instead of a box some of the parts are a little bit bent out of shape because of this. 
Jenda,Parres,8/24/1985,188, 4.0 , This particular model kit has its origins a half-century ago. and people have converted them with a lot of skilled work to run on OO-gauge model railways. As a static model it needs careful work. It will reward extra effort. This isnt for the beginner. It has to lose a star because the manufacturing standards have improved. A modern kit could be so much better. But one day there just wont be any more of this model.
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,189, 5.0 , Just what I was looking for
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,190, 5.0 , These are really nice quality HO coaches and lightweight too so you can pull quite a number behind even the smallest loco.I bought several for branch line operation and they certainly add inpact to the layout.
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,191, 5.0 , great
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,192, 5.0 , True to product discription 
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,193, 2.0 , Much smaller than thought. 
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,194, 5.0 , charming little train
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,195, 4.0 , Just built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators (which can be glued inside the roof) the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I dont agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in. (They cant go in first) Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point with the windows correctly in place the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body (upside down with the metal weight located). The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesnt lift and drop as freely as it should now. Its on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order (without feeling I was going to break something) that Ive docked a star.
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,196, 5.0 , I received this lovely train today and I am really happy with this purchase. I am not a collector but this is a gift for my father in law and I am sure he is going to love it. It is really well packaged comes in its corgi box. Inside this box is a hardened case and the train is secured in it. The attention to detail is fantastic. It is in perfect condition and I am sure that this will make a lovely addition to anyones collection. I really like the stories behind these trains and choosing of the name. It arrived really well packaged and very fast4 days early in fact.  Great buy. May turn me into a collector yet! 
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,197, 5.0 , Well made and highly detailed model 
Etty,Piercy,12/6/1970,198, 5.0 , VERY GOOD AND ACCURATE MODEL OF THE DAYS OF STEAM. WELL DONE. Fits perfectly in my display cabinet with the other
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,199, 5.0 , Happy with this purchase for our 4 year old grandson who is trainset mad.
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,200, 5.0 , Excellent engine arrived a day earlier than expected extremely well wrapped. New and about £10 less than the list price. Just had a test both ways on my layout runs brilliantly- thanks guys. 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,201, 5.0 , My son was very pleased with the product
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,202, 5.0 , Arrived in good time. All good and works well. Son is very happy. Thank you.
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,203, 5.0 , So cheap but an excellent product. At this price any bulb failures experienced after switch on are no problem - just re-order some more. Arrived on time and were well packed. I dont know how this level of authenticity can be available at such a low price. 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,204, 5.0 , The item was excellent but the scale was 1/100 I would have preferred 1/76 scale. Some information of how to set up the lighting system would have been helpful ie. the size of transformer required for the no of lights being used in parallel or in series 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,205, 5.0 , the single head lamppost lamps complimented the double head lamppost purchased to complete the trainset layout 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,206, 5.0 , These are great so bright and value for money
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,207, 5.0 , These ex-LNER Gresley teak-bodied buffet cars built in the 1930s survived long enough to receive all three British Railways coach liveries crimson and cream maroon (in which this model is also currently available) and finally the blue and grey depicted here used from the mid-1960s.  Ive given this one 5* as opposed to the maroon ones 4* as in my opinion it looks much better in this blue and grey livery.  The reviews are virtually the same apart from that rating.  Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build. Its stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E whilst the one depicted here E9131E lasted only until 1974.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and whilst a scale person wouldnt fit into the gap between the seats and tables you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail. Its a lovely little bar/counter complete with chrome edging an (empty) transparent sandwich display case what looks like a chrome coffee-maker and one of those metal foot-rests running the length of the bar/counter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level. No stools though presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches over-priced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hard-earned.Theres also a representation of the hand-rails at the windows by the buffet bar/counter to hold onto going over the points at junctions (or after a few expensive tinnies (which is all they used to have (and still do as far as Im aware) in the beers department.Read more › 
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,208, 5.0 , Fantastic.
Willie,Blaske,1/11/1974,209, 5.0 , My first venture into Hornbys new TTS system - I only have a basic Bachmann E-Z controller which can only provide functions 1 to 9 which work ok - I have no idea what functions 10 to 18 do - very frustrating.  All the mags have tested TTS so no need for me to comment - the chuff is too loud in my book but otherwise Im very pleased indeed with my purchase... 
Joana,Waldie,7/6/1986,210, 5.0 , Top notch train with sound as good as the Bachman version. 
Joana,Waldie,7/6/1986,211, 5.0 , Typical Hornby quality especially with their own sound chip which probably knocks over £120 off having to have one fitted. 
Joana,Waldie,7/6/1986,212, 4.0 , Looks great well packaged and arrived quickly..what more do I want 
Corrianne,Forder,9/18/1996,213, 3.0 , With TTS Sound this is a bargain. Smooth-running and nicely finished. 3 issues though: Not as detailed as the Bachmann version; Buffers are not sprung; The tender is ridiculously lightweight. If the TTS is important to you then its good value.
Corrianne,Forder,9/18/1996,214, 4.0 , The interactive Chuggington is a brilliant idea. However I was left a little dissapointed. I was under the impression each chugger interacted with each other automatically. This is not so you have to continually press the horn of each chugger and then they will interact and comment on what is around them i.e tunnell chugwash etc....This is ok for older children who have grasped the idea and know what to do. But for younger children it reverts to a push along train and in effect is no different from the die-cast edition. I know as my child gets older he will develop his play but I feel a little mis-led by the concept. I have also had to return the action chugger as the paint on the wings was peeling. I have asked for a replacement however as action chugger is the main man in our household! Enjoy! 
Corrianne,Forder,9/18/1996,215, 4.0 , My 3 year old son loves his talking trains - they are in his top 3 toys. We initially bought him Koko and Wilson for Christmas but could not find a Brewster to go with them so promised him one for his birthday then we got him the Brewster with track and tunnel set. I have to say he gets more pleasure from the trains than the tracks which are rather fiddly to set up (grown-ups have to do this) and he doesnt seem to have grasped that you have to raise the drawbridge with the little lever - if you raise it by hand it tends to lift off the tracks so Im constantly having to help him put it back. He also keeps switching the tunnel off for some reason. However the toys are very sturdy the trains in particular have been subjected to a certain amount of bashing but have withstood all ill treatment (I do take them away if he gets too boisterous).The trains are beautifully made - bright sturdy cheerful and just like their TV counterparts with nice clear voices which are also individually distinctive. They prompt imaginative interactive play - he talks to them and makes up stories for them and we have to stop him taking them to bed with him otherwise he would stay up all night chatting! There seems to be quite a wide range of comments between the trains although disappointingly only a couple of responses to the tunnel and drawbridge. The trains respond over quite a large distance for example he has left one on the stairs and you could hear it joining in while he played with the others in the living room so I would say at least within hearing range. Of course now he wants the Chugwash (he saw it on the side of the box) so further sets & trains will have to be added in future...Read more › 
Corrianne,Forder,9/18/1996,216, 5.0 , I bought this for my 3 year old son for christmas and he hasnt stopped playing with it for a last minute purchase it has turned out to be the best.  He loves it so much ive just bought the straigh& curved track and the extra level track to make it even more enjoyable... what i love most about this is that you can buy so many things to add on so for easter ill get him more for the track so hell never get bored.I along with the othe persons review thought the trains would automatically interact with each other but my son is getting used to pressing the buttons more now so its not so bad i think for a younger child they wouldnt get as much fun from the interactive part.On the whole I would definately recommend this product... have fun chugging everyone xxx 
Corrianne,Forder,9/18/1996,217, 5.0 , I bought this (with an extra Wilson loco) for my very bright two year old grandson over 18 months ago.  It has easily been his all-time favourite toy and he always wants to play with it when he visits.  The larger size of the locos are just the right size for him to play with by himself and and the interactive noises keep him interested for ages.  The track must have been set out and taken up over 100 hundred times now but everything still works perfectly with absolutely no broken parts (which I find amazing). 
Corrianne,Forder,9/18/1996,218, 5.0 , This toy has been arrive in time. This a really good point and were just got what we wanted . We didnt open it yet  but I think this toy  will be fine. Many thanks. 
Corrianne,Forder,9/18/1996,219, 2.0 , An interactive toy with few elements and too expensive....it looks like durable. I dont like this product! thanks for your attention. 
Corrianne,Forder,9/18/1996,220, 5.0 , excellent set easy for my 4 year old to put together and the interactive trains are really good highly recommended
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,221, 5.0 , Fully satisfied with the supplier/delivery/ and performance of this product.
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,222, 5.0 , Very good product with fast delivery
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,223, 4.0 , Its an N gauge BR Mk1 Restaurant car nicely modelled and free running under magnification even the tiny signs on the windows and underframe are ligible.
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,224, 5.0 , Add to my Hornby collection.
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,225, 5.0 , Absolutely great exactly what it should be.good quality. A very pleased partner
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,226, 5.0 , Great item
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,227, 5.0 , delivered ahead of estimated date and is a first class item
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,228, 3.0 , Its ok just a train to push around doesnt go on its own. Only has a couple of phrases on its own. I only have 2 interactive trains they say a few things to each other but not a lot. You would need everthing for it to say as much as it can! To be honest my son would have been happy if it didnt say anything at all. He played with them when I first got them and now they dont get out of the toy box much but thats just kids! 
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,229, 5.0 , Ordered a pair of these toys for use with the Interactive train set which I got my son for Christmas.First impressions are that the toys had me and the wife chuckling away in astonishment at how smart they are they will actually recognise who they are talking to by name and interact with a couple of sentences. Most times it seems to be a different phrase but I can imagine the kids having loads of fun as I believe they will interact with the track itsself as well.Got them on special offer with Amazon would work out fairly expensive paying full price for them all but for a fiver each SUPER!!! 
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,230, 1.0 , My daughter bought this for herself with her Christmas money very disappointed when it turned up and wasnt English speaking.We have Wilson and when they speak English they are great thats the only reason it has been marked down. 
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,231, 4.0 , We bought this for our little boy Koko is the only train whos name he can say and as soon as he opened it we got a big smile :)Koko says lots of different phrases to the other trains and appropriate things at the different stops - chugg wash rock quarry etc. She also uses electricity from the refuelling depo so she is different to the other trains we have that all take diesel.It is also nice to have a girl on the team as most of the other trains are male (wilson brewster mtambo chatsworth dunbar etc).Overall; well worth the £5.55 we paid for it! Recommended for Chuggington fans!8 out of 10. 
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,232, 5.0 , Wilson and Koko purchased for grandson.  Atrrived promptly; excellent value as on offer at Amazon.This interactive railway set is just amazing; a trainfastic Christmas! 
Meggi,Roke,6/13/1945,233, 3.0 , Have to be honest i genuinly expected the engines to move themselves. Judging by the fact the engines are twice the size of the standard ones and why put a non slip type surface on the slopes when their to be pushed by hand ? I bought 3 different sets to build a larger layout and not a hand in site on any of the pictures !Quality of the track and engines and extras very good but the technology to make them move is not new  and would have been so simple and easy to install as they need batteries anyway. 
Lian,Muirden,5/28/1978,234, 4.0 , Slightly dissapointed that they dont interact automatically. You have to continually press the horn when approaching another chugger or tunnell chugwash etc..... great for the older child in the age range. 
Lian,Muirden,5/28/1978,235, 4.0 , This was bought for a little boy who is nearly 3it was a present Im told by his mum its much played with.
Lian,Muirden,5/28/1978,236, 5.0 , Excellent swift service and quality product.
Lian,Muirden,5/28/1978,237, 4.0 , A very good train set and very popular with the young infants in my family (from 2-5 years old).  The range of layouts that you can build is good and the pieces are easy to assemble even for little ones.  Both trains run well in the tracks.  The wood is a good fine grain that does not splinter easily and is well finished so is safe for children to handle.  It is also quite robust.  A couple of minor issues.  The track supports for the elevated section are rather too narrow and can fall over easily.  If they were a square section they would be more stable and support the elevated pieces much better.  This can be remedied by cutting duplicate supports and glueing them together to make the square cross section.  Also a couple of extra pieces to act as joining pieces would help add yet more variety to the layout designs.  One that is needed is another double hole joint and the other a double plug connector.  Nevertheless overall it is a highly recommended product that can keep youngsters safely occupied for hours.  But for these minor failings I would have given it 5 stars. 
Lian,Muirden,5/28/1978,238, 4.0 , The only problem is that you have to play very delicately with parts of the set as the bridges are raised up on wood blocks that are easily knocked over by small hands and feet. 
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,239, 5.0 , Fantastic train set my 2y/o loved this.  A few of the connector pieces have come out but that is easily fixed- otherwise excellent condition and good value for money 
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,240, 1.0 , Looks great but poorly designed. Most of the track is raised up on wooden blocks easy to knock over my 3 year old was unable to use easily.
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,241, 5.0 , a high five this time round because it is a very well engineered and crafted piece of machinery and it runs real smooth also she has got the lines(a good looking body)that is why i recommend this product to all you budding railway enthusiasts out there and to those who are thinking about getting started (you do not need an anorak) just a lot of enthusiasm and a will to create plus she rolled in on time and delivered well boxed and securely wrapped by a very courteous gentleman again a good job well done excellent  many thanks to you all  thank you 
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,242, 4.0 , Very good value for money 
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,243, 5.0 , I like it arrived on time running fine. 
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,244, 5.0 , this was wonderful and  great value 
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,245, 5.0 , ok
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,246, 5.0 , FIRST CLASS
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,247, 5.0 , A superb model from Hornby of the ex.GER J15 0-6-0 mixed traffic locos which I remember regularly seeing in my 1950s childhood during long holidays with my grandparents in rural East Anglia. Only so far given limited test running this loco will soon feature on a layout currently being built based on the old GER Audley End - Bartlow branchline. Runs very nicely and incorporates a stunning amount of fine detail. Has me feeling quite sentimental !
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,248, 5.0 , This is a finely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways (Epoch 1) baggage/post wagon in the standard epoch 1 green livery with a grey-green roof. It is a short four-wheeled vehicle with smooth flat sides and two end platforms. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows. The running number is Munchen PpostL 21029.This model is fitted with the standard ‘loop’ style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with the usual transparent plasticky internal packaging but with only a base and two folding-up end-pieces no top.This is a beautifully detailed model as you would expect from Trix with some fine details already in place but there is a packet of delicate bits for you to add. It is of a high quality of manufacture.Note that I paid £32 for my model so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops – or even a distant one.
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,249, 4.0 , Excellent quality and sensibly packed.
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,250, 5.0 , This has been bought to send to a 2 month old baby in America called Duncan.  His Mum is amazed that I have found it and is awaiting its arrival.  It was delivered the day after I ordered it in perfect condition.  Thank you.  You have made one new Mum very happy. 
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,251, 5.0 , Great train as I have many of them . My child loves it has it goes with the rest of them 
Candida,Cella,4/21/1996,252, 5.0 , Grandson loved it 
Clyde,Aitchinson,2/18/1984,253, 5.0 , Perfect
Clyde,Aitchinson,2/18/1984,254, 5.0 , Walthers Trainline make great  but not expensive freight cars - and they couple closer than Bachmann cars
Clyde,Aitchinson,2/18/1984,255, 5.0 , This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a long wooden wagon with a seated driver and various sacks inside and with two horses hauling it. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser these figures are of a high quality of manufacture detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £14 for my set so it pays to shop around in your local model shops – or even a distant one. I live in London but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.
Clyde,Aitchinson,2/18/1984,256, 5.0 , This is a first class model up to the usual Kato standard. A superb runner straight out of the box.
Clyde,Aitchinson,2/18/1984,257, 5.0 , Excellent for the purpose  for which I bought it - making rock formations for a model raileway
Clyde,Aitchinson,2/18/1984,258, 4.0 , this is a suppurb addion to any train set n kids love hanging mail bags on the hook that the coach picks up n drops off as it goes round only problem is the the trigger mechonisums are a fiddle to fit to track n keep popping off! the instuction are naff but the drop-off works well over railer uncoupler track 
Clyde,Aitchinson,2/18/1984,259, 5.0 , This is a new addition to my Flying Scotsman train set and fits in well with the other coaches already added. 
Ulysses,Kasper,12/2/1976,260, 5.0 , Amazing. It really works.  Well done hornby. 
Ulysses,Kasper,12/2/1976,261, 5.0 , A birthday present from my daughter to give me something to do over Xmas. I found it reasonably easy to fit to my track and with a few minor adjustments could pick up the sacks of mail. The grandchildren will enjoy this extra activity on an already busy layout.
Ulysses,Kasper,12/2/1976,262, 5.0 , Train set received in excellent condition good quality and worth the money as u receive additional trake side acceceriesAnd delivered well within time scale will be buying more items in near future keep up the good work. 
Ulysses,Kasper,12/2/1976,263, 5.0 , I bought this product for my younger brothers Christmas. It arrived well within the proposed delivery period and in perfect condition. All of the relevant paper-work was included and - most importantly - its intended recipient is thrilled. 
Ulysses,Kasper,12/2/1976,264, 5.0 , Youngest son bought this with his birthday money. He is over the moon with it. 
Ulysses,Kasper,12/2/1976,265, 5.0 , Good quality  well worth money  was delivered in good time 
Ulysses,Kasper,12/2/1976,266, 5.0 , My son loved it and best value I was able to find on the market didnt disappoint and added track B very effectively. 
Rivalee,Ousby,9/7/1994,267, 5.0 , This was a very good purchase for Christmas was a larger layout than expected but very good all the same 
Rivalee,Ousby,9/7/1994,268, 5.0 , bought this for my 7 year old son its for xmas so he hasnt seen it yet but im very pleased. 
Rivalee,Ousby,9/7/1994,269, 5.0 , Great train set my grandson loved it.  P BARBER.
Marion,Aubry,7/6/1998,270, 5.0 , These signals are good value for money and are relatively straightforward to assemble from the instructions. Definitely worth a try for your first attempt. 
Marion,Aubry,7/6/1998,271, 5.0 , Great product.
Marion,Aubry,7/6/1998,272, 5.0 , Excellent model in perfect condition from reputeable amazon seller however it was returned for a refund because its couplings were not compatable with my other Railjet coaches. I was previously ignorant of the fact that Roco Railjet coaches with internal lighting do not have the same couplings as those without. Roco Railjet coaches 64722 / 64723 / 64724 have internal lighting powered through connections in the couplings.
Marion,Aubry,7/6/1998,273, 5.0 , This is the older E7 model from Kato but still carries there quality hallmark It fits in great with my Japanese model railway although you do need the 3 or 6 car extension to give it a better feel. 
Marion,Aubry,7/6/1998,274, 5.0 , SMOOTH RUNNING TRAIN VERY PLEASED WITH DELIVERY
Marion,Aubry,7/6/1998,275, 4.0 , Excllent model with accurate details.
Marion,Aubry,7/6/1998,276, 5.0 , See review for over head station 
Mile,Ogles,7/9/1942,277, 5.0 , All good
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,278, 5.0 , Good track good tight fitting perfect 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,279, 4.0 , good product
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,280, 5.0 , Bought as its cheaper than the alternatives for basically the same thing. Looks the part engine drive not tender thankfully. Very well detailed and the seller I bought from was faultless arriving by Parcelforce three days later. 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,281, 5.0 , This is a really nice looking model train.It is DCC ready and in the oo gauge scale.The details are really nice and I just love the colour of this model train.I have wanted this for a long time and I am not disappointed by it at all.My ratings of this model train are 5 star for fun as when this is on anyones track it will not disappoint in the fun it will bring you.The educational value I have left blank as I dont really think that there is any educational value to this as its there to be looked at or used on a model railway track to be an addition to a collection of your model railway.The durable rating is 4 star as it feels nicely made and solid however I am sure if its dropped from a height then it would most probably cause damage and finally the overall rating is a 5 star as its a beautiful addition to any model railway.Highly recommended to any model train enthusiast or simply as a decorate model to just look at either way I am sure you would love this train. 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,282, 5.0 , This model is very reasonably priced  and the best thing about Hornby Railroad series models you can upgrade them with extra partsto look more realistic but they are good realistic models at the price in there own right Recommended 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,283, 5.0 , This model is equal in looks and performance to the more expensive Hornby version although having a different motor it pulls at least 6 coaches smoothly and easily. 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,284, 4.0 , bought this for my sons birthady later this month so rating is based on the quality of the other Hornby we bought at the same time for Christmas 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,285, 5.0 , Railroad offers more robust options for younger users while still offering good performance. This product at this price represents outstanding value. 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,286, 5.0 , excellent value and could not ask for better service the engine was spot on and great value for money great 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,287, 5.0 , A nice loco. BUT it doesnt go round tight curves if the track is the new Hornby standard
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,288, 4.0 , Runs well...need some mock passengers in the seats!
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,289, 5.0 , My daughter loves this and runs and jumps about with excitement 
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,290, 4.0 , Loses a star for being too loud. Its great otherwise. The lights are pretty and the bump and go movement is fun for my 3 year old.
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,291, 5.0 , Great model
Jimmie,Valens-Smith,5/17/1980,292, 4.0 , Arrived as expected and worked fine straight out of the box. It seems slightly wider than most so be careful if you use parallel tracks especially flexible track. 
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,293, 5.0 , Quick delivery excellent great looking train set very smooth running and fast. Good value with 4 car set no problems at all with it. 
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,294, 5.0 , Great train set for any enthusiast and a must have for all modern train sets 
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,295, 4.0 , Very good track needs to be on a board 
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,296, 4.0 , Good model
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,297, 5.0 , Fantastic detail! A beautiful model traction engine. Hopefully recipient will be thrilled as brought up in the town where Pat Collins lived and became Mayor. His Wakes were held yearly during August Bank Holiday and were the highlight of summer. These beautiful traction engines were then always used to power the rides and alongside fairground organs are pure nostalgia!
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,298, 5.0 , easy to couple with other models great to expand set of power trains.  This is ideal as a gift to complement the starter kit which come with only one engine
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,299, 5.0 , I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. I have also bought him others in the series. They are very strong toys due to being die cast and do take a lot of banging and bumping about during play without damage to their paintwork.My grandson is obsessed with rescue scenarios at the moment and loves to bring Kevin in to help if James crashes. The fact that James talks too enthralls him. He gets so excited everytime he gets a new engine as he wants to hear what it sounds like. He has to date..Thomas Spencer Percy Diesel Tobyand some others. He has Bertie bus and a small Harold too.Its great they have magnets too which means all the engines can pull each other and their tenders. He likes to swap them all about and put them all together in a long line. This is one of the toys Ive seen him having the most pleasure from so far. He plays contentedly for hours with these engines making up his own scenarios.I have more of these put away for him and have just given him Spencer which he again loved.One little comment I wish it was made plain in Amazons product details which ones talk and dont. Which are die cast etc I find myself sometimes going through products for an age or going to other sites to make sure I have the right one.Sometimes a search for talking brings up non talking in the mix as well. Not a major point and not a dig at Amamzon as I use them constantly and Im always pleased with the service but it would make shopping for these quicker and easier. Brilliant toys all round great fun and kids love them. 
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,300, 5.0 , Great little engine! My son loved the fact he lights up and makes sounds. 
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,301, 5.0 , As all these toys this one does not disappoint. They are hardy toys which is a good thing with my 3 year old son and he gets alot of enjoyment out of them.Would recommend. 
Amos,Ashenhurst,1/21/2012,302, 5.0 , Lovely little toy robust well made and very amusing that it talks will keep my Grandson happy for a while shame its not a little bit larger but very pleased with it. 
Weidar,Dartan,6/28/1956,303, 5.0 , quite small-but perfect for any small Thomas lovers- my 2 year old nephew never lets Thomas or James out of his sight!!!
Weidar,Dartan,6/28/1956,304, 4.0 , The carriage arrived promptly  it is in good condition and described accurately. It was a little expensive although a little cheaper than a new product. In retrospect i would make the purchase again.
Weidar,Dartan,6/28/1956,305, 5.0 , Excellent.  Well worth the wait for delivery from Japan. Fits n gauge passenger coaches really well. My 2nd purchase of this product from this supplier. Thank you. 
Weidar,Dartan,6/28/1956,306, 5.0 , A quality storage case for your N gauge trains. Easy to remove inserts. You just pull out the ones you want. No cutting is needed. My Kato train set fits perfectly.
Weidar,Dartan,6/28/1956,307, 5.0 , just what my husband required for his train set layout
Weidar,Dartan,6/28/1956,308, 5.0 , Fab  coaches  look very good and stable  far better than the fairish ones :) and they have pick-ups so you can have lighting etc ..
Weidar,Dartan,6/28/1956,309, 5.0 , Just what was required a good buy thanks!
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,310, 4.0 , I paid 170. At that price it would have been nice to have a dcc chip supplied with the loco .Having said that most of these are destined for display cabinets as is mine. For that reason it loses a star. Superb in every other respect.
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,311, 5.0 , Everything you need to get started bought seperately this set would be double the price - all you need is two DIY paste tables a room to put them in and a big kid to set up and a little kid if he is lucky to watch and join ion a little bit 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,312, 4.0 , At £50 this is a bargain and a really good set to start off a model train hobby. My 5 year old was desperate to have his own proper train set and I was concerned over getting one of the >£100 sets so this fit the bill. The track mat is a great idea and didnt take long to assemble it all.My only problem was with the controller. Everytime there was a derailment the controller would stop working for about 1 minute one of its safety features. I gave up with it in the end and got a better one off the Internet. 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,313, 4.0 , NOW ALL WE NEED TO DO IS KEEP BUILDINGAND HES LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT :) THIS IS HIS FIRST TRAIN SET AGE 7. 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,314, 3.0 , This product was really good to start off with.Unfortunately the motor carriage broke pretty quickly.To solve: take the blue roof off and charge a screw driver with static.Take dust off the motor by hand and then remove it with the screwdriver.After this has been great although for £50 you can get the lakelander with extra track and a much better motor carriage!Overall Good but better hornby out there... 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,315, 5.0 , The look on my sons face said it all. This is perfect for any budding modeller. Will be putting the track on to a slotted board so its quicker and easier to set up. My sons jaw hit the floor when he opened this on his 5th birthday last week. Excellent quality build too. 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,316, 5.0 , Bought this for my 4 year old train enthusiast..He loves it.. It is a bit tricky to put on the track but once its on its perfect.No good for a heavy handed child but as long as they are quite careful its great.He has used it every day since Christmas 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,317, 5.0 , Fab item great value for money! Would highly recommend this to all.A must for anyones collection for hrs of fun! 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,318, 5.0 , it is amazing great money you should get it for sny present ot home use detail is amazing and a great hornby set everybody should have one.
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,319, 4.0 , Model is a very reasonable representation of th real thing  one thing that grates is the tender brake shoes not inline with the tyres see no excuse for this toytrain extra.Bad point Bachmann. 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,320, 5.0 , Fine would buy again
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,321, 5.0 , Absolute superb kit and exactly what I wanted!I didnt buy this kit to just build a Rainbow because in my opinion I dont like the Rainbow type of ride (i think its rather boring!) I actually bought it so that I could convert it into a Inverted Pirate Ship for a small diorama.The Kit itself is fantastic Highly detailed and a wonder to build. Its also very easy to modify if thats what you want to do! 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,322, 1.0 , OK if you are in to ~Airfix models as these have at least 300 seperate pieces.. 
Austin,Mandres,12/4/1968,323, 5.0 , Bit small I thought it was a real lot bigger But is very good 
Cordey,Palfery,8/15/2000,324, 4.0 , Very good 
Cordey,Palfery,8/15/2000,325, 5.0 , Perfect
Cordey,Palfery,8/15/2000,326, 5.0 , great addition to my collection
Cordey,Palfery,8/15/2000,327, 5.0 , This a really accurate model of the Brighton Belle as it first appeared in 1932. Its detail correct up until about 1952 when new bogies were used to help improve the ride and the second(third) class Pullmans changed their logo to simply Car No.88 etc.I have bought the full 5 car set using matching coaches also made by Hornby. The Hornby list price is right for what you get but my budget doesnt go that far so Ive shopped around and found absolute bargains both on amazon and ebay sites as sellers discount their stock to get a quick sale.The train itself runs very well and although there is only one power bogie it is more than adequate to pull the whole 5 car train up the 1 in 30 inclines on my layout.The chassis is made of metal which gives extra adhesion but the real key to this is how Hornby have arranged the power collection for the lighting to run from the power car itself through the couplings to all the cars rather than collect it from each of the carriages bogies. This way there is no additional friction at all from pick-ups which might reduce power.It runs perfectly well in either direction even though the power bogie is in one of the end driving cars.Well done Hornby and well done amazon for providing the market place where sellers can provide the discount I need.
Cordey,Palfery,8/15/2000,328, 5.0 , very good but this is not from Una  Coombs because she died over one year back
Cordey,Palfery,8/15/2000,329, 5.0 , Great thanks! 5 stars!
Lura,Skipping,10/7/1994,330, 5.0 , arrived well ahead of time
Lura,Skipping,10/7/1994,331, 5.0 , I bought this for my 3 year old son who is obsessed with Thomas and the Trackmaster collection. He absolutly loves the day of the diesels film so I got him this train along with Den Dart and Bell. Its still great fun like all previous trackmaster trains and is fantastic for any child who loves playing with trains. I think its great for developing imaginative play too as he now makes the diesels and steamies role play and talk and weve painted an old box to make a diesel works. He absolutly loves diesel 10 and takes him everywhere. The only criticism I would have is that he requires a C cell battery which I have to replace every 2-3 days but this is probably because my son literally plays with him from the moment he gets up to the time he goes to bed! 
Lura,Skipping,10/7/1994,332, 1.0 , TrackMaster should redesign this toy.  I gave it to my grandson on Christmas Day.  He had been asking to have a Diesel 10 for months and was so pleased when he opened it.  The battery does not stay in place.  Any jolt or movement dislodges the battery which has only the metal connections to each end holding it in a large space.  We tried packing it with card but in the end playdough all round the battery filling the cavity held it in place so he could play with it.It is so disappointing for children when new toys dont work.  This is not the only Thomas engine that needs better design. 
Lura,Skipping,10/7/1994,333, 5.0 , I knew what to expect and was not disappointed. Another Thomas the Tank Engine train to add to my grandsons collection.  He was very happy with it. 
Lura,Skipping,10/7/1994,334, 4.0 , Ok...the engine itself is well made and should last. But its damned expensive for what it is.I would also note that the grabber is fixed with only the jaws opening. True a fully mobile grabber would last around 2 hours with the average small boy but I would just take note in case its expected.The lad loves it though so minor quibbles only... 
Lura,Skipping,10/7/1994,335, 5.0 , Our son loves the Thomas Trackmaster trains and track. Luckily he already has a couple of sets as this playset is just a train.It does say what is included in the details to be fair but I still think the product name is misleading.I cant fault the train though other than the claw arm being fixed in place. Its the first thing our lad tried to move! 
Lura,Skipping,10/7/1994,336, 5.0 , My three year old watched day of the diesels recently and all he wanted was a diesel 10 toy. Thank goodness for Amazon as I couldnt find this toy in any toyshop. He is now planning which engine is next on his list.......whichever one he picks I will be back to Amazon to buy it! 
Lura,Skipping,10/7/1994,337, 4.0 , My 3 year old got this for Christmas he loves it although his only negative comment was about the grabbing arm on top. It is fixed in place and doesnt move. However Diesel 10 loves racing around the track up to no good. 
Odilia,Dumbrell,11/27/1958,338, 5.0 , Bought this as a Christmas present for a little boy who loved it he is mad about the character. It works well on the track and face is much more realistic than the smaller diecast model.
Odilia,Dumbrell,11/27/1958,339, 5.0 , This is a nicely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways (Epoch 1) 3rd class express bogie coach – type CCu - in the standard epoch 1 lined green livery with a black roof. This is a very modern style of side-corridor coach with end-vestibule entrances and ‘concertina’ connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows such as the partitions and seating (which differs slightly from the 1st and 2nd class coaches) and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is CCu 13017 and the destination board is for a Munich to Berlin service.This model is fitted with the standard ‘loop’ style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with a transparent plasticky internal tray with side cover.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture. Note that there are other models available to form a rake of the Munch to Berlin coaches along with a baggage car.
Odilia,Dumbrell,11/27/1958,340, 5.0 , Yes 
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,341, 5.0 , Good
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,342, 5.0 , Great price and product. Very pleased with purchase and service.
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,343, 5.0 , This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a high-sided blue heavy wooden wagon with a driver standing inside it and two horses hauling it. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser these figures are of a high quality of manufacture detail and colouring. Note that I paid £12 for my model so it can be worth shopping around in your local model shops – or even a distant one. I live in London but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,344, 5.0 , Smashing train grandchildren will love it
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,345, 5.0 , Beautiful model well detailed and has a solid feel to it. They say keep em in the packaging but i never listen hehe regardless this loco model is truly beautiful; sad that this particular gresley never got preserved but still this is a fitting tribute to the silver link :) 
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,346, 5.0 , A very good  highly detailed model a bit smaller than I expected but well made and well worth purchasing. 
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,347, 5.0 , ALL THREE MODEL STEAM ENGINES ARE PERFECT THEY TAKE ME BACK TO WHEN I USED TO GO TRAIN SPOTTING AND WATCH THEM ROARING THROUGH THE STATIONS 
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,348, 5.0 , Excellent product well pleased with it. Delivery time great too. 
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,349, 5.0 , excellent present
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,350, 5.0 , Track needs to be very clean and does not cope too well with points.
Jess,Heggadon,11/19/1993,351, 5.0 , this train is amazing for young children as so well built and the carriage joining are so more less frustrating for them highly recommended
Alley,Claiden,2/21/1953,352, 5.0 , Excellent value for money and as stated 
Alley,Claiden,2/21/1953,353, 5.0 , great value arrived early still boxed
Alley,Claiden,2/21/1953,354, 4.0 , A challenging assembly especially in the valve gear area lots of lovely fiddly bits be very sparing with the glue! I remember the same problem half a century ago with the original Airfix kit. Airfix original tooling is used to create a finely detailed modelWith painting care a couple or more kits are cheap enough to make excellent props rusting forlornly away in a siding waiting for the scrapman 
Yvon,Bowland,11/26/1987,355, 5.0 , Fantastic little kit. Some fiddly bits but with careful glueing and assembly the drive gear and wheels will turn. Would buy again. 
Yvon,Bowland,11/26/1987,356, 3.0 , cant relly comment on it as I have not built it yet but the moulding looks okay for the age of the original kitfor the price I dont expect it to be perfect. 
Yvon,Bowland,11/26/1987,357, 5.0 , This is my third need I say more.
Yvon,Bowland,11/26/1987,358, 4.0 , nice not suitable for my grandson
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,359, 5.0 , First rate little models beautiful mouldings nicely painted and simple to click together. Ive caught the Shorty bug !
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,360, 5.0 , As usual from Dapol quality kit.Easy to follow instructions and with care an excellent model appears.Paint and glue required 
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,361, 5.0 , Good value exactly what I wanted well packed will buy again when required  a good range of products well done 
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,362, 5.0 , Good item for the model railway 10/10 
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,363, 5.0 , perfect
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,364, 5.0 , First time thatIhave used these itemsand I was very pleased with the results.I was not sure if I had ordered the correct Friction-Bearingsbut no fear I had and I was pleased.  Mike
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,365, 5.0 , Excellent model loco with finite detail
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,366, 5.0 , It was a Christmas present for my grandson I brought it because he like playing with trains and things like that.
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,367, 5.0 , Very good.  Dont forget to include a current limiting resistor.  That said they draw so little power I have 30 of them on a layout.  Ive also painted them with a translucent yellow paint bright white.
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,368, 5.0 , This product is designed as a scale model for adult collectors - it is not a toy for children and the Amazon category should reflect that.However turning to the actual product - the Sir Nigel Gresley A4 Pacific Class Locomotive model which is supplied with tender - it is a nicely presented scale model which is highly detailed in terms of paintwork wheels pistons and piping etc.  The amount of work that must have gone into producing this model is significant and it has resulted in a good quality model especially in view of the price. I think the finish is very good although it is a static model eg. the wheels etc. do not rotate and it is fixed to its stand which is effectively a short length of track. The real locomotive is preserved by the North Yorks Moors Railway and this replica certainly does justice to it.The model is supplied in an outer sleeve which protects a clear plastic case in the case of my model it also has a removable thin plastic film over part of it as an additional protection. At the price you couldnt really ask for more and if like me you are short of space the 1:120 scale is ideal. Recommended. 
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,369, 5.0 , I bought this as a present for my dad for Christmas as he is a massive fan of trains especially Sir Nigel Gresley. It is a shame that it doesnt go on his railway track but it is still a very well made and lovely product. I would defiantly recommend this as a gift for someone who is a fan of the rail legends. 
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,370, 4.0 , He was delighted with this model. As a train fanatic he was not disappointed. He has seen the real Sir Nigel Gresley on a number of occasions. 
Florenza,Coaster,5/16/2006,371, 5.0 , Bought as an 80th birthday gift for retired train driver. He loved it!  May buy similar for may husband who was very impressed. 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,372, 5.0 , Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Good attention to detail  and all round a good buy and worth the money
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,373, 5.0 , First one was faulty so sent it back. Basically all the gear surrounding the wheels fell off after a few circuits of the track.. Amazon are brilliant with returns and the replacement runs like a dream. Sixteen sounds in all using the elite controller and eight if using the select 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,374, 5.0 , Great locomotive well packaged and presented even better than expected would recommend and buy again. 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,375, 5.0 , I run other locos but this one is the only one with sound it now adds to the layout 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,376, 5.0 , Bought with the Flying Scotsman. Excellent and well packaged 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,377, 5.0 , The engine is amazing and the sound totally blew me away 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,378, 5.0 , The husband is very pleased with the train
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,379, 5.0 , Please check the picture.  The code previously used for this item was incorrect and I am having trouble uploading the correct picture.
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,380, 5.0 , Beautiful setquiet big
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,381, 4.0 , Accurate details well modelled.
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,382, 4.0 , Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money (especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!) the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal! 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,383, 4.0 , This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs ABC and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I dont have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail you can see into the windows each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost I would not let young children play with it on their own but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more › 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,384, 1.0 , Especially as discounted by Amazon this is a good price for what is mostly an attractive and well made train set. Id classify it as a younger-modeller or beginners set in that the detailing isnt as fine as Hornbys more expensive models or of some of the others in the market e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality but does need laying carefully on a hard and properly flat surface - I certainly wouldnt use the trackmat on the floor. Train sets like this really need a level of preparation and investment in a solid baseboard and without one youll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy; its held in place by a tiny thread of unsupported soft plastic; after about ten light uses of the set its already nearly snapped off and can no longer support its own weight.I purchased this as a project to build with my young son and with memories of the Hornby set I had as a boy. Its really disappointing to find that its many good qualities are ruined by a small but crucial element that renders it quickly useless. 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,385, 5.0 , Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12-year old son. Surprisingly the mat turned out to be made of vinyl and not paper as described (I guess that Hornby listens to its customers!). This on top of the high quality track carriages and engine it made the perfect gift. A little forward planning helped as we had a sheet of thin board ready to ensure a smooth surface for trouble-free track set-up. The bottom line is that our son is thrilled with the set and is currently shopping for track expansion sets to spend his Amazon gift vouchers on! 
Sadella,Daleman,4/5/2006,386, 5.0 , I had small clock-work train sets and eventually progressed to a small electric train-set with a circular track - the train did smoke (when it was in the mood) but mum was wary of letting me play with it alone and in any case it only went round in circles. I am now the proud owner of the Flying Scotsman from the famous Hornby and this particular (OLD) little boy is like a dog with two tails (at least). What a wonderful set designed as a complete starter set with mat track etc etc.This quality product is very possibly going to be the start of something big very big. It would make a dream gift for any boy OR girl (whatever age) by a maker that you can trust - and you get an iconic engine as well with its wonderful colour and memories of times past.....
Efren,Plail,2/19/1972,387, 5.0 , JUST WHAT I NEEDED. RUNS WELL SOUNDS GOOD ARRIVED ON TIME TAKES A BIT OF GETTING USED TO BECAUSE IT A LOT SLOWER THAN MY OTHER ENGINES. 
Efren,Plail,2/19/1972,388, 5.0 , This is a very useful item and I am very pleased with it at this price comes highly recommended a must have for modellers.
Efren,Plail,2/19/1972,389, 4.0 , I needed a low voltage switch in my recording studio and this fit the bill very well the cost is a bit high for what it is but it does the job I need it to service very good
Efren,Plail,2/19/1972,390, 5.0 , A smooth quiet running loco with excellent detail. A great addition to my layout.
Efren,Plail,2/19/1972,391, 5.0 , This Hornby 1st class Pullman centre coach matches the Brighton Belle driving cars in livery detail and quality. Recommended addition to make up your 5-BEL Brighton Belle 5-car set.
Efren,Plail,2/19/1972,392, 5.0 , I love it. Perfect with the earlier ordered locomotive.Again: I would recommend it to the masters of the topic. Its not just a toy.
Efren,Plail,2/19/1972,393, 5.0 , Absolute bargin so good I bought two. I been after this type for a while. Plastic and metal well moulded. 
Efren,Plail,2/19/1972,394, 5.0 , great item to add to railway sets
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,395, 4.0 , Really solid metal construction. British made. Its how kit used to be made. Additional outputs add ancilary power. Nice solid controls. 
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,396, 5.0 , Delivered on time and works well. 
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,397, 5.0 , Works as expected. Thank you.
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,398, 5.0 , I purchased Hornby brand because of the usual excellent quality and i am very pleased with all the items except for the so called track mat  which is very disapointing as it is just a sheet of thin paper printed with mostly olympic themes  .The themes are not rarely suitable for a train layout only the actual track position is revelent so Hornby should go back to the proper  heavy duty trak mat as in the past. 
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,399, 5.0 , This was an early Christmas present wanted it as it was a special train for the olympics not only got the train but also some track and a transformer would consider it a good buy the train runs smoothly it has white light on the leading unit but no reds on the rear but for the price was not surprised at this.Looks good running around my track. 
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,400, 3.0 , Bought this for my 8yr old son as a starting point to have a real train set and although the set is great once up and running it does feel as though its been made on the cheap. The track is of a good enough quality however the trains feel a bit plasticy and the slightest touch knocks them off the track which can be very frustrating especially when its so difficult to get them lined up on the tracks in the first place!Shame as hornby always made good products and although fun once you get going you do feel its alot of money for what it is will persevere with it though for now just hope my son doesnt lose interest through its flaws. 
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,401, 5.0 , I am delighted with this lovely train great value. A lovely gift for a little boy so I bought it for my Grandson. He will be delighted when he get this for his birthday. Highly recommend.
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,402, 5.0 , So very good wished I had ordered 2 now. 
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,403, 5.0 , fantastic
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,404, 5.0 , Excellent toy. Grandchildren loved it. Very well made and worth every penny. Lots of additional animals trees etc. Quickest way to build is to erect the 3 straight pieces first then put tunnel over and build back.
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,405, 5.0 , This was purchased as a gift for a friend in recognition of the very considerable help he has given us in rather troubled times.
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,406, 5.0 , AOK
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,407, 5.0 , VERY PLEASED 
Nerty,Sarvar,5/2/1981,408, 3.0 , Overpriced with very little detail.
Sterling,Lukasen,8/8/2010,409, 5.0 , Excellent models.
Sterling,Lukasen,8/8/2010,410, 4.0 , Excellent model of this ubiquitous engine.
Sterling,Lukasen,8/8/2010,411, 5.0 , When you consider that HO foreign wagons cost upwards of £20 each to get eight wagons at this price is incredible value.  I purchased three sets.They are also well detailed and the wagon with the covers actually operates (the flaps all open and close).
Sterling,Lukasen,8/8/2010,412, 5.0 , Great Little item with fantastic detail.  Its used in my model village setup and looks really good.  The details is very accurate and I love it.  Highly recommended. fantastic quality as always
Sterling,Lukasen,8/8/2010,413, 5.0 , brilliant little camp sitepurchased at grandkids request to fit into scenics on oo model railway.matches in great grandkids love it. 
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,414, 5.0 , Well made and designed. Ideal for the home modeller or collector.
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,415, 4.0 , the product is good and it runs smoothly on my track word of warning it is not a motorized unit it istwo cars that go on the front and back of the main train they do light up and theoretically you could get a katomotorized chassis and swap one of the middle boogies for a motorized one but i havent tried it.apart from that it is a well built and sturdy model and it is a really good purchase 
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,416, 5.0 , ok bit disappointing no English instructions??
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,417, 5.0 , They are fantastick hopper they make a train and a good one at that and looks good with the right loco.thanks amazon
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,418, 5.0 , Good item well pleasedgood service.
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,419, 5.0 , This was a great buy and came with a loco to pull it along. Great service a good value for money
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,420, 4.0 , This model is DCC ready as the description states.. It is ready for a digital chip to be fitted  by new owner. If the model has a chip fitted by the manufacturer it is described as DCC fitted. 
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,421, 5.0 , Bagnall industrial locomotives are hardly represented in the model market.  This delightful loco is therefore very welcome!  It adds character to a layout and runs very well - with DCS I would expect it to perform superbly.As a model it is slightly chunky and possibly a bit taller than original - but it is running on 00 track so the purists have much to do anyway.  It stands detailing and weathering well and can rapidly be made to look the part.  Bagnall products were characterised by endless variety about a basic design so small departures from scale are not really an issue.The biggest compromise on looks is with the chassis - but Hornby have made the sensible decision to adopt an available proven option.  Much improvement in looks can be acheived by installing skirts to cover the wheels.  It will then much more resemble the prototype at little cosmetic and no mechanical work.This is a great success at the ready to run stage and forms a good base for detailing for the more advanced enthusiast.  Well done! 
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,422, 5.0 , thanks 
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,423, 5.0 , fantastic 
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,424, 1.0 , Not DCC ready as advertised
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,425, 5.0 , The couplings are extremely delicate but the detail is mind blowing and she runs perfectly!
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,426, 4.0 , The whole set is quite nice in appearence and had the additional bonus of providing a book with the story of Spencer the train in question. My kids love trains so this one was a nice addition to their Thomas collection. Good Value for money. 
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,427, 5.0 , This is a really well made Thomas toy and a great addition to my sons collection of Thomas toys.  For the price and receiving four different pieces (I dont count the items in the trolleys) this is a really great buy. 
Kerr,Chismon,7/22/1987,428, 5.0 , Muito bom esperava rapidez e qualidade e foi o que aconteceu quanto ao produto está acima do que esperava muito bom mesmo recomendo a todos os meus amigos 
Kristin,Gurton,2/24/2013,429, 5.0 , My 4 year old son loves Thomas and loves this train - the fact that it comes with 3 carriages makes it good value for money.  Quality is good. 
Kristin,Gurton,2/24/2013,430, 5.0 , these really was a bargain for the price i paid they was delivered early  and the boy really loves them the quality of these are brill 5star 
Kristin,Gurton,2/24/2013,431, 4.0 , I have bought this item for my grandson for his Christmas so won`t be able to review this item till he opens it on Christmas day. 
Kristin,Gurton,2/24/2013,432, 4.0 , Searched for this without success.  A very difficult item to trace at a reasonable price so delighted to find it on amazon.
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,433, 5.0 , A superb model at fantastic value very pleased with my purchase.
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,434, 5.0 , HAPPY WITH TRAIN GOOD DELIVERY THANK YOU
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,435, 4.0 , Runs well....need some mock passengers in the seats.
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,436, 3.0 , I ordered this engin and 5 letters to spell a name as I thought it made a delightful christening gift I had seen them in other peoples homes and knew its what I wanted. However when I received the letters they are green blue green blue red. Not the best mx of colours I expected to receive one of each colour but there is no yellow the red letter on the end looks a bit odd. If I order again I would specify one of each colour. Also the letters on the carriages are not glued on they just come off which I had not expected. Not quite as robust as I had anticipated. 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,437, 3.0 , My children love these but its very annoying that the letter doesnt actually stay attached to the train. It just slips on and off and is therefore mostly found off the train rather than on. 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,438, 5.0 , Loved the product.  It is very colourful and  I thought that the  magnetic fixings are brilliant and better than the usual fixture that other sets use.  Highly recommended 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,439, 3.0 , Not a bad little train but very expensive compared to cost of much bigger set bought. Letter not fixed so easily lost &it does not fit under bridge on set we purchased to go with it. 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,440, 4.0 , Seller was very prompt and very helpful and contacted me via email and phone. I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone. Even organise a refund for me as he noticed that we had over ordered a letter by mistake without us even asking for one.Toy looks great and seller has organised it well for us have not tested these items for durability yet though! 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,441, 5.0 , I have bought similar trains in the past and they make ideal christening / birthday presents. They can be used for display when the baby is small and then be used as a toy when the child gets older.This item is good quality and is well presented.My friend loved it and I will definitely buy again for future christening presents. 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,442, 5.0 , I have bought similar trains in the past and they make ideal christening / birthday presents. They can be used for display when the baby is small and then be used as a toy when the child gets older.This item is good quality and is well presented.My friend loved it and I will definitely buy again for future christening presents. 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,443, 4.0 , The letters lift off so as they say it isnt suitable for young children unless you remove the letters and put them on when theyre older. Fits most standard train tracks. Looks lovely as a personalised gift. Shame there werent more choice of colours for each letter lots were unavailable.
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,444, 5.0 , This is just some hornby single straights tracks i bought for my train set.What can you really say? its a peice of track none of it was broken nicee clean it all had warning stickers on.Thats about it...Perfect. 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,445, 5.0 , This is a piece of model railway track with a well known brand name.  Even though they are manufactured in China these days they still seem to be made very well. 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,446, 5.0 , FIT FOR PURPOSE GOOD BUY GREAT PRICE SPEEDY DELIVERY WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY.ITS A TRAIN TRACK THATS ALL FOLKS. 
Guntar,Willisch,9/3/1997,447, 4.0 , ideal for the use 
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,448, 5.0 , value for money
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,449, 4.0 , There is little choice in the H0 market for High Speed Trains and Mehano had a niche market. Thankfully in my experience with the Thalys and now Duplex models in comparison to the similarly priced Joueff - later Lima/Hornby - these couple and run better!This set bought as one of the last available in 2013 was made in 2004 (date stamp in box)  and I have since discovered an italian stockist has 5 more available at lower cost: Dealers nearer to the area these trains ran naturally seem to charge higher prices.
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,450, 5.0 , Very nice and functional model of train 
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,451, 5.0 , great product great service. 
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,452, 5.0 , All good
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,453, 5.0 , These trains are basic but a great little runner I have a full set of 5now and I also have much more expensive trains and these run just as good and even better than some of them so please make some more of similar trains.
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,454, 5.0 , This bus does the job so is great value - my son loves all this stuff so no complaints On the old motor road system it tends to get a bit stuck on some tight corners but that was all part of the fun for my boy.The toys are cheap but well made and recognisable and although they all seem to take batteries in a different way and of a different size - some take AA some AAAs and I have a train that takes a C type battery -  Im still happy. 
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,455, 5.0 , My son was delighted
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,456, 5.0 , Bought as a gift for my 7 year old son who saw these on TV. They are fab fun! Drop them punch them even throw them down the stairs and watch them shake. The noises are gross enough to keep any little boy amused and the karate sounds are great.Great product that should bring a smile to anyones face. 
Kiley,McDonell,11/5/2009,457, 4.0 , My boys were desperate for these toys for Christmas and Santa didnt disappoint. They make really funny Ninja noises when chucked and thrown around and are very robust. However there isnt very much you can do with them so the novelty wears off quite quickly and then they are more like cuddly toys that end up in bed with the kids!Not sure I would recommend buying these toys. It was only a result of excellent advertising in early Autumn which led to my kids adding them to their list for Santa. Also these toys need AAA batteries which you need to buy which is a pain. 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,458, 5.0 , Purchased for autistic friend (4yrs old) in Carpentersville Illinois USASomething that he may not break too easily and has enjoyed similar gifts 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,459, 5.0 , was bought for my g/son for christmas which he received early as i wont be here to spend christmas with them this year ...he loved it and said i was the best gran ever which made my day..................... 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,460, 5.0 , Quirky and fun. Great as a game  to throw about punch in frustration! So a lot of fun uses. I like the unusual look of them. There not just the same as all the other toys! 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,461, 4.0 , purchased for my son. he enjoys this toy and the fact that it makes lots of noise. more of a collectable than an every day toy. never the less still a favourite. 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,462, 5.0 , Purchased for my 6 year old grandson who has just got his first belt for Karate .  I know he will love it.  Seems value for money. 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,463, 5.0 , I bought this for my Grandson for his birthday he was very excited when he opened his present and played with it straight away
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,464, 5.0 , Really lovely cuddly little guy. The stitching on his hat was coming away but it was easily fixed! Now my Moominmamma has a companion!
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,465, 1.0 , ordered this there was no PB embroidered on the coat opposite colours to PB - very disappointed 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,466, 5.0 , Paddington arrived today.  He is exactly what I wanted - he is a gift for a child and he is exactly what she asked for. 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,467, 4.0 , Paddington arrived super quick (from Amazon in Peru!!) Thank you!I had read other reviews for this bear seems there are variations but happy to say that mine has PB on his coat but no label this is fine as Id worry my Grandson would try to pull a label off!He is 21cm high (not 28cm) hes in sitting position (if you stretch his legs out he does measure 28cm)He has nice soft fur & quite squashy to cuddle.Ive bought a collection of Books & DVD for a Paddington birthday so this little chap completes the set!! 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,468, 5.0 , Fit for purpose a nice reasonable sized Paddington to take to school now on my sons bed good quality item. 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,469, 5.0 , I received this bear today and it is SO SOFT!!  Both the bear and the coat are so soft! Mine has a blue coat with the PB sewn in and a red hat. The coat is super soft it feels as soft as a cloud!! I love the wooden buttons as shown on the picture.  The bear is smiling which is cute. I am very satisfied with this Paddington Bear and thank you!!  Thumbs up! 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,470, 1.0 , Item not as describe NO PB logo and opposite colours to original Paddington BEAR 
Tybi,Smout,11/9/1956,471, 4.0 , Paddington appeared to fully met the expectations of the gift receiver although I would have happily paid a little extra if he had been attired with regulation Wellington boots which I felt was a disappointing omission. The felt jacket and hat are quite well-made and the overall quality is good. 
Jacquenetta,Futcher,9/20/1956,472, 5.0 , Great but then we noticed that both boots were left foot
Jacquenetta,Futcher,9/20/1956,473, 5.0 , Charlie bear rainbow was brought for a work colleague for a leaving present.
Jacquenetta,Futcher,9/20/1956,474, 5.0 , Cute small did the trick

Jacquenetta,Futcher,9/20/1956,477, 5.0 , We were travelling in the United Kingdom and found the Yoohoo animals.  My daughter was delighted with the design and colors. 
Jacquenetta,Futcher,9/20/1956,478, 5.0 , My daughter loves yoohoos and this one has not disappointed dont think she will be happy till.we collect them all! 
Jacquenetta,Futcher,9/20/1956,479, 5.0 , Pink and big cute eyes. Our daughter loves it. We had to buy another one for her best friend. Well made. 
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,480, 5.0 , A very cute Yoohoo. Arrived quickly and in proper package.Nice present for Christmas.
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,481, 4.0 , Not bought for childs education and cant think of any educational value. It was a fun thing for my wife to put in the car. Hole for finger slightly too small. 
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,482, 5.0 , Arrived on time. Beautiful well made puppet. Not as depicted in photo is actually a plush fluffy fabric with a silver back Lovely.
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,483, 5.0 , My little boy needed a cuddly meerkat and we chose the TY beanies one for Christmas. It is very soft and cuddly and my son is very happy with his choice.
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,484, 5.0 , My son is Henry Hugglemonster mad and we already have both the Henry Hugglemonster Talking Henry 25cm Soft Toy and Henry Hugglemonster Talking Summer 25cm Soft Toy soft toys but his little baby sister is always trying to swipe them from him!  I noticed this little 15cm soft toy version of Summer and thought she would be ideal for my daughter and the fact that it was on offer at just a third of its normal price basically sealed the deal. My problem now is that I gave it to her to play with bu now my son keeps swiping Summer from his sister!My son absolutely loves the Henry Hugglemonster television show on Disney Junior and its the one show guaranteed to make him completely stop what hes doing and gaze with rapt fascination at the television with lots of smiles and giggles every couple of minutes when Henry or Summer sings or does something funny and my daughter is also transfixed whenever the programme is on too so a bit of a Henry Hugglemonster mad household here!The toy itself is lovely and soft and despite the conflicting age recommendations in the product description (in the main description it says from birth and in the technical details it says from 36 months) I think it is probably suitable from birth rather than 36 months as I cant see any small parts that could come off and be a danger to a baby as the eyes etc are all stitching as opposed to buttons/beads although there is no age confirmation on the label attached to the toy.Read more › 
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,485, 5.0 , Baby Lillie loves it she loves Henry Hugglemonster on the TV and has done nothing but play with this.For £2.00 it is such a good price as i have seen them in other shops for much more than this. Also a sensible size so can be taken out and about with you.Made really well and good for babies 0+. 
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,486, 5.0 , Bought this for our 3 month baby. She seems to enjoy playing with it and its nice and small for her little hands.

Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,491, 5.0 , Bought daughter for Christmas she was very pleased with it and plays with it a lot! We didnt realise that the panda actually eats the food if you keep pressing its tummy then it poops the food back out! Daughter found this amusing! 
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,492, 4.0 , My 5 year old daughter loves this panda! it is slow to feed and in my opinion doesnt do a lot for the money however she has never put it down therefore it has been a success. 
Mela,Copeman,11/19/1942,493, 2.0 , Daughter was happy with it until food got stuck. No easy way to get it out and D was upset panda didnt work anymore. Very disappointed 
Enrico,Duetschens,4/10/1997,494, 4.0 , Bought for my 7 yr old it looks cute and makes a few sounds. Amused her and her 10 yr old sister no end when it poops out its food!

Enrico,Duetschens,4/10/1997,498, 5.0 , my daughter loves these she never puts them down
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,499, 5.0 , Its hard to write a review on the Internet but I must say that this soft toy will be on this Earth even longer than I will be because it is to me a symbol of British civilization and power and I thought that the Olympics marked the heights reached by Anglo-British empire. Its worth more than I thought it can dance and make noises it comes alive and does a dance for you its an incredible toy. If you read this you should consider buying it. 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,500, 1.0 , The delivery speed was good but I got a soft toy version without a medal and no mechanics or dancing. Not how it was described. 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,501, 5.0 , Fantastic product really amused my baby 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,502, 5.0 , Bargain - fantastic Christmas present.
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,503, 4.0 , Got this snake fox and mouse all together. Weve already got the gruffalo (well my 3 year old has). We now re tell the story which is great except I always seem to be the bad one. It came quickly and they are standing up to the gruffalo (in his onsie suit) biting the poor thing. A great toy. 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,504, 5.0 , I bought this for my two year old daughters birthday to go with the other characters she already owns from the Gruffalo. I think this soft toy looks least like the book character but my daughter instantly recognised it and has enjoyed playing with it. 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,505, 3.0 , I bought this as a present for a friends daughter for her birthday - I was disappointed with just how small it was and I didnt think the quality was very good.  (The 4 year old recipient loved it however) 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,506, 2.0 , Nice looking exactly how discribedhowever after 2 day of my daughter playing with it the stiching come apart same as the snake and fox toysdissatisfied with the manufacturer quality 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,507, 5.0 , My nephew loves the Gruffalo books and the characters. He likes to re-inact the story using all the toys i have bought for him. Gruffalo snake mouse owl and next is the fox!! 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,508, 5.0 , This was that last piece of the set that we were missing so couldnt be happier great for helping bring the story of the gruffalo to life when I read it to my toddler. 
Ilyse,Scannell,1/19/1997,509, 5.0 , This toy was brought to complete a collection of Gruffalo toys for my 4yr old son which he loves he uses it to retell the story now with the characters. 
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,510, 5.0 , I bought all of the characters for my grand-daughter for her third birthday and she adores this one particularly.  She calls it Owlie.
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,511, 5.0 , This was lovely a gift for my grandson - well made and perfect size for tiny hands. This item arrived well within the time limit. Thank you. 
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,512, 5.0 , I was very pleased with this lovely little meerkat bought for my granddaughter who loves it. Soft fur lovely face.
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,513, 5.0 , Grandson loves the angry birds he now has quite a collection good quality item and quick delivery x
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,514, 4.0 , Brilliant card and postage but was expecting a bigger size card. Maybe next time they should announce the size of the card as I was shocked when I received if. But overall brilliant
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,515, 5.0 , This is a lovely decorative pumpkin & good quality. Its already brightening up my room in preparation for Halloween. Im hoping to be able to buy another next year its so nice.
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,516, 4.0 , My daughter is getting quite a collection of Mashers and this set is her most recent acquisition. As with all of her other Mashers they are well made and hard wearing and lots of fun.Weve had hours of fun swapping pieces around.Negatives? Lokis horns keep falling off which is very irritating.The Hulk and Loki are very different sizes so their accessories arent as interchangeable as some other Mashers. They fit but tend to fall off or just dont look right. I wouldnt consider this a good starter set for that reason. 
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,517, 5.0 , my son was very pleased with his purchase. 
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,518, 5.0 , Excellent service very happy 6 year old :)
Bucky,Ridwood,2/26/1965,519, 5.0 , this is the worlds biggest soft toy i thought it was going to be little but i was wrong absolutely huge i cant stop hugging it. It is so fun to play with and getting more like this is something Im already doing. cant put it down. 
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,520, 5.0 , Thank you for this cute and high quality product. Was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it. Would recommend this product to anyone that loves cuddly toys.Arrived quickly which was good too! 
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,521, 5.0 , Thank you this toy is beautiful happy costumer :))
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,522, 5.0 , Love it its so cute and comes with its own death certificate! 
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,523, 5.0 , Brilliant unusual quirky gift
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,524, 5.0 , Bought this for my daughter for Xmas as she has the app on her kindle she loves it  looks just like the actual character on her game soft enough to take to bed and cuddle and not to big so she can take it out and about with her. Would recommend.
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,525, 4.0 , This bear is a TY beanie baby called Kicks.American TY Warner invented the first beanie baby in 1986.Each of his beanie babies has their own birthday. This beanies birthday is August 16th 1998 {hes a Leo!}Also each beanie baby has its own heart shaped tag with a poem inside.The front of this tag reads TY BEANIE ORIGINAL BABY and inside this tag this beanies poem reads:The world cup is his dreamKicks the bear is the best on his teamHe hopes that one day hell be the pickbut first he needs to improve his kick!The material of this bear is green with flecks of blue in it and if he gets dirty hes surface washable.Kicks would be a fun gift to give to any football/soccer sports teddy bears or TY lovers because hes very soft and very cute!Utterly fabulous!
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,526, 5.0 , This little fox resembles its (Gruffalo)character well.Would recommend to others. Looks great with the other gruffalo soft toys. It is better quality than the owl but equally as good as the snake mouse & gruffalo. 
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,527, 3.0 , This was a stocking filler for a child brought up on Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler. Its a faithful representation of the illustration and is well put together. Its worth noting the size when purchasing however because 7 isnt big for a stuffed toy. Maybe this is why it hasnt got nearly as much play time as we expected. Would I buy it again? No - Id go for something bigger without a doubt. 
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,528, 5.0 , This was bought for my 3 year old grandson as a birthday present and he really enjoys playing with it. 
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,529, 3.0 , I dont know what is this character - just bought it for my daughter since I liked the funny look. Its a decent toy but I dont like 2 things. First of all the  fox cant sit. Maybe Im the lucky guy who has this toy in such flat state but it looks like a few elephants slept on it. Nothing changed 2 weeks later so maybe my fox is just disabled. Second thing is the difference in colour between the tail and the rest of this creature. They are so different that it feels like the tail comes from a different fox. All in all my daughter plays with it occasionally so this is good enough. 
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,530, 5.0 , Fantastic looking fox bought in preparation of new born a bit reluctant to give to parents as the eyes may come off if pulled or bitten by child only my observation I think I will wait until baby is a bit older that said this is a beautiful toy well made and an exact likeness to the gruffalo fox I love it. 
Patric,Pechet,11/24/1975,531, 3.0 , I bought this as a present for a friends daughter for her birthday - I was disappointed with just how small it was and I didnt think the quality was very good.  (The 4 year old recipient loved it however) 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,532, 4.0 , I do love this fox dont get me wrong but the tail is a different colour orange than the rest of him!  The picture otherwise is very accurate and I still love him despite his different colour tail  :) 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,533, 4.0 , I was pleased with the product and arrived before predicted delivery date.I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for the small version of the Gruffalo toys to tell the story with.
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,534, 5.0 , I dont regret buying this it what Ive been wanting for since the day I first played doom 1 and 2 and now I have a awesome plush replica of the Doom guy. 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,535, 5.0 , Hes quite a big little dude :)
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,536, 4.0 , Binky the Panda is one of 6 join in and play Blue Nose Friends. A medium sized toy soft to the touch and very well made. If you have any problems with Binky and she wont talk then you probably havent switched her on. Theres a little on/off switch just above the battery compartment. If she still wont speak then change the batteries (3 x AAA).Binkys interactive and will chat to the other join in and play characters. Sit Binky and friends close together press a paw or squeeze their tummy and off they go. The toys are sensitive enough they know which of their interactive friends are close by and call one another by name. Only two in the group will speak though. They dont all talk at the same time.The more toys you have in the series the more phrases they use and the longer they chat. Unfortunately they dont say much and each one has just a short series of phrases which they repeat over and over. They also dont have any facial movement and though their voices are slightly different theres no way of telling whos saying what unless youre really close by.Its worth bearing in mind their plush fabric cant be washed because of the battery pack. You can wipe them down with a damp cloth but I really wouldnt recommend these toys for serious rough and tumble play.Incredibly cute my granddaughter loves them but they are limited in what they say. 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,537, 5.0 , A delightful toy - really does have a conversation with any other Blue Nose Friend but can just be played with on its own when it will talk to its owner!  Not too big for little hands.  Easy to make it talk and to change the batteries.  I had one small issue when it arrived as the batteries were flat but that was soon put right and Binky ready for my grandaughter to play with. 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,538, 5.0 , what a great price my daughter loves this they are really soft and cute well worth the money would buy more 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,539, 3.0 , This was a bit of an annoying toy! it is a good size though and very cute and would be loved by children! 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,540, 5.0 , I bought this as a valentines day present for somebody special and they fell instantly in love with him he is soft a very good size for the prize and very very cute. Comes in a very good packaging and would highly recommend to anyone font of pandas. 5/5! 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,541, 5.0 , I bought this panda for my grand daughter and she absolutely loved it.  She collects blue nose friends and has many but did not have one who talked to her.  Very delighted with this purchase. 
Nehemiah,Kreber,9/1/1972,542, 4.0 , My little girl loves these we started with 2 now have 4. they needed batteries changing when they arrived they must have been ex display (hence the price) but once we did this they worked great. 
Maible,Fearney,1/8/1998,543, 5.0 , I got this for a friends daughter for her birthday and she loves it. Very soft and cuddly would be nice if could say more phrases but great value at the price I got it at (£5.99)
Maible,Fearney,1/8/1998,544, 5.0 , I bought a Build a Bear and this is one of the outfits that I bought to go with it.  Every Bear should have a party dress. 
Maible,Fearney,1/8/1998,545, 5.0 , Got this for my friends daughter and she loved it! 
Maible,Fearney,1/8/1998,546, 5.0 , it was a gift she loved it. 
Maible,Fearney,1/8/1998,547, 5.0 , great
Maible,Fearney,1/8/1998,548, 4.0 , This bear is a retired (no longer being made) TY beanie baby called Juggles.American TY Warner invented the first beanie baby in 1986.Each of his beanie babies has their own birthday.This beanies birthday is October 9th 2004.Also each beanie baby has its own heart shaped tag with a poem inside.The front of this tag reads TY ORIGINAL BEANIE BABIES and inside this tag this beanies poem reads:Who has a big red funny nose?And floppy shoes upon his toes?A squirting flower? A spinning tie?Its a friendly clown here to say HI!I only gave Juggles a 4 star durability rating because of his paper tag (if its constantly read it wont last.)Juggles is surface washable and would make the perfect fun gift for a TY teddy or circus lover.
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,549, 5.0 , Cute good quality and a bit bigger than I expected
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,550, 5.0 , Awesome. Great condition inline eyes perfect shape and untouched!!I LOVED IT SOOOOO MUCH!!!!
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,551, 4.0 , My first reaction was disappointment at the small size but on checking my order I saw that this was as advertised.  Having bought other similar items I was expecting something bigger for the price.  That said my son loved it and also delivery was very quick in spite of the snow.  It seems well made though the tail is a bit too floppy at the end.
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,552, 5.0 , A good companion and sounds very realistic
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,553, 5.0 , Well the missus loved it.. Not much more to say really.. Ideal gift for someone that fits the words on the bear
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,554, 5.0 , Lovely soft little beanie. My son loves it and takes to bed everynight.  Arrived quickly. Very pleased with product. 
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,555, 5.0 , This George pig pirate teddy is just perfect! It arrived exactly as described which is great! This is for my niece who is peppa pig and pirate crazy she loves swashbuckle the programme so I thought this George in a pirate outfit would be the perfect combination for her and it went down an absolute treat with her she insists on taking it everywhere with her which pleases me greatly as it means I have spent my money very wisely. The teddy itself is of an excellent quality which you would expect of this make it is very soft and has absolutely so loose threads or anything the colours are lovely and bright and vibrant this teddy really is excellent and I will happily purchase more from this range to add to the collection. 
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,556, 5.0 , my two-year old nephew does not let it go. it can be only washed (and dried) in the middle of the night when he is asleep. 
Hermann,Ferreiro,9/11/1991,557, 5.0 , Purchased for a little lad who is a pirate and Peppa Pig fan!  Nice little gift and I am sure the recipient will be delighted with it! 
Lenka,Bradlaugh,1/26/2005,558, 5.0 , Lovely soft George Pig beanie toy. Seems good quality. Came in a plastic bag with tags attached. Very happy with purchase! 
Lenka,Bradlaugh,1/26/2005,559, 5.0 , Great my little boys was very happy! It stays on his bed and sleeps with it every night. Brill product. 
Marven,Barbrook,1/25/2005,560, 5.0 , Cute! Son loves george pig. Very small but its only a stocking filler. Arrived in really good time

Marven,Barbrook,1/25/2005,564, 5.0 , Always wanted a Steiff teddy for my child finally indulged now he is three. Pricey but they feel really special. He has a lovely face and really soft fur utterly beautiful and the absolute perfect size for my preferences. A bear to treasure. Hopefully an heirloom <tries to justify price!>. 
Marven,Barbrook,1/25/2005,565, 5.0 , Very cute teddy and well made.  It is a soft bodied teddy unlike some of the Steiff bears which are hard.  This one is lovely for a child.
Marven,Barbrook,1/25/2005,566, 5.0 , My Nephew loved this a soft toy for a boy of 7 he liked playing with it and pressing the button to make the sounds work It was great to see him play and be rough with it without fear of breaking. 
Marven,Barbrook,1/25/2005,567, 5.0 , Absolutely great. A good piece for the collection.

Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,574, 5.0 , My little girl loves this sid toy she like to play with it when shes watching the films. 
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,575, 5.0 , A great gift for ice age fans. Thought it was quite small on arrival but my 5 year old loved the size and it was perfect for carrying around with her where ever she went! 
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,576, 5.0 , My 3 year old grandson loves Ice Age especially Sid so this willbe a stocking filler for hima;pmng with other things. 
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,577, 5.0 , My two year old loves the Ice Age DVDs so we bought him the main character beanies he loves them they are an excellent likeness so instanty recognised them and very well made.
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,578, 5.0 , This is a lovely cuddly toy. For young children well made 
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,579, 4.0 , Good quality toy as always
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,580, 5.0 , I bought this as a companion for my exuberantly affectionate male rabbit in an attempt to curb his endless advances on my feet.  He wasted no time on formal introductions and instantly took a shine to his classy new lady friend.On the off chance that this is not the standard purpose for buying a stuffed toy rabbit I can also say that it seems well-made is a good size and to a realistic scale (slightly smaller than my adult rabbit).  The fur material is soft stuffing is plump and beans give a decent weight and the eyes dont look like theyre going anywhere soon.It was realistic enough that people mistakenly thought it was real in a photo I posted of the toy in the rabbit cage.  Obviously is doesnt look real up close but its excellent quality from a toy. 
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,581, 5.0 , Hello...  I’m a very well behaved young bunny with a very soft silky coat which is just waiting for you to stroke me.  I have soft gentle eyes which will look beseechingly into yours in the hope that you will pick me up and cuddle me a snub nose with whiskers and quite a serious expression but with just the faintest hint of a bunny smile - I’m at that uncertain stage in my life where I don’t know where I’m going to be living or when this will be but all I want is to be chosen and loved and make you or a child very happy.I am made from quality materials which a thick plush fur coat and Living Nature have a close eye for detail in giving me a thick plush fur coat on my body but shorter denser fur on my ears.  I am very soft with my carefully stuffed body and have a few beans around my rear end to offer a different texture and add a little weight which makes me very huggable and squeezable too.  You have probably already noticed that I am very lifelike and from a distance I could possibly be mistaken for one of those other bunnies that run and hop around with their ears swinging.Regarding my vital statistics I measure 28cm from the tip of my nose to the base of my soft fluffy tail my hind legs are 15cm apart and my head is 12cm above the ground.  I am child-safe but I would also be happy to play with adults too.  My lopped ears are silky soft with a shorter-pile fur on their underside but for some reason they have been stitched close to my head by my breeder at ‘Living Nature’.  A quick snip of the stitch holding them down has released them enabling them to swing freely and much more naturally just as I see on my larger lagomorph relatives.Although I am a very well-bred bunny I am not quite sure about my breed and would like to keep you guessing.Read more › 
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,582, 5.0 , A beautiful life size and very realistic beautifully soft toy lop eared rabbit - my little granddaughter who loves rabbits is delighted with it - ideal toy for all who have children begging but not quite ready or unable to have the real thing! 
Sibylle,Winkett,3/26/1996,583, 1.0 , reason for buying it was wanting a good sized rabbit . states it is 30cm but its ONLY 12CMS....where is the other 18cms gone to then ???? 
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,584, 5.0 , This was bought for my daughter who loves it.  It is a soft and well filled rabbit and cute as well. 
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,585, 5.0 , This is a really realistic looking bunny soft toy.  I ordered this as a present for a bunny mad little girl and she declared that it was perfect and looked just right (apart from the feet look slightly different to an actual real rabbit).  Its fur is super soft - and the detail on this rabbit is beautiful right down to the lion rosettes in the fur.  The colour of the rabbit is sent at random and I received a greyish coloured rabbit so it is a bit of a rabbit lottery as to which colour you will receive. 
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,586, 5.0 , Absolutely beautiful. Really please with this purchase. I bought it to go with my rabbit/hare themed room and keep thinking theres a real rabbit sat on the bed! 
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,587, 5.0 , Absolutely gorgeous.  Looks so real and feels so soft.  Great value for money.  Would recommend this product and company as they delivered promptly
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,588, 5.0 , Many thanks for quick delivery - Dog enjoying it very much 
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,589, 5.0 , Another bagpuss for my sons collection he loves it
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,590, 5.0 , Lovely and soft my grandson will love it
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,591, 3.0 , very small so not going to be one the kids can get big cuddles from. Also head is huge compared to body (more so than on the pictures) so it looks weird and tends to fall out of little arms when trying to cuddle it. 2yo happy enough with it and hasnt managed to destroy it which is probably what counts. 
Barbey,Shapera,5/4/1977,592, 4.0 , A bit smaller than anticipated but the recipient loved her at first sight. 
Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,593, 5.0 , My grandaughter loved this

Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,597, 5.0 , Our little friend had fallen in love with Happy Feet and penguins in general she was delighted to receive the Teddy Hermann Penguin for Christmas. 
Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,598, 5.0 , Very lovely nice in touch good to hug. I would recommend it to children who like to sleep with their toys. 
Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,599, 5.0 , he was lovely just what I wanted my nephew had another penguin given him as well but it was not a patch on mine I was very pleased  and I would buy this make of cuddly toy again. 
Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,600, 5.0 , Looked everywhere for Penguin like the John Lewis advertisement.  Teddy Hermanns more than met my expections and has gone everywhere since with one little boy since Christmas Day 
Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,601, 5.0 , Been looking for a soft penguin for my son for ages and this is the only one I found that was realistic- although it was expensive for what it was! 
Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,602, 5.0 , Excellent quality great price our girl loves them will definitely shop with you in the future many thanks
Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,603, 3.0 , Arrived not working so had to take packaging apart to try new batteries as ones inside were very rusted. Now works well and so have reassembled torn box round it for Christmas. 
Brena,Ferrai,12/25/1968,604, 5.0 , My 5 year old says he is super good. Loves the noises. We have s collection of these little guys now 
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,605, 5.0 , My great niece was overjoyed when she received this as a present. 
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,606, 5.0 , Great thanks.
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,607, 5.0 , My wife loved this thank you. :)
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,608, 5.0 , I love this Webkinz as she is so soft and cute and very cuddly.it is my favourite webkinz toy 
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,609, 5.0 , Great good appearance and very very very soft and cuddly :)
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,610, 5.0 , lovely.
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,611, 5.0 , My Blue Nose Friends are an off-shoot of the Me-To-You Tatty Ted range.Leboo the Lion is lovely and soft to the touch.  His pastel yellow body salt and pepper grey mane grey patches black eyes and whiskers and trademark blue mark nose.He is incredibly tactile and strangely calming to have in front of me.I found this lovely little lion in a local Thorntons but since his appearance on my desk at home he has attracted a lot of attention so I will have to get another so my godson can have his own and my own little lion can remain unmolested by my computer screen.I used to collect beany babies and buddies when I was a child and I was surprised to find out these little darlings have beans in their tummies too.Leboo is number 126 in the Blue Nose Friends collection and was released in January 2014 - so if like me you are new to the series then finding the early ones may be a forlorn hope but you never know your luck.I will admit that little Leboo has a placed in my heart and not just on my desk. 
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,612, 4.0 , Loved this just wish it was a bit bigger... I should have measured out just how small 4 is so hard to gauge these things based on a picture.Quality was super arrived on time and all good things! 
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,613, 5.0 , Cute little bear very soft. As described. Arrived in good time. 
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,614, 5.0 , Lovely little teddy son loves his little stocking filler. 
Cacilie,Swalwel,4/17/1999,615, 5.0 , A super gift for a little girl that had just become a big sister 
Kiah,Dering,10/6/1995,616, 5.0 , Gorgeous little lion. Perfect for our Gryffindor daughter! 
Kiah,Dering,10/6/1995,617, 5.0 , So cute and little makes a lovely gift
Kiah,Dering,10/6/1995,618, 5.0 , The intention was to purchase this toy for my niece; I have a pug boy Rexi and my niece adores him so got her her own pug bear!It didnt work out that way Rexi (the pug) saw the toy and adores it (he s a bear cuddler) Now Rexi the pug has his own Pug!This pug toy is adorable so soft not really a beanie toy some beanies in the rear so that it sits but very soft bigger than you may think too! Price was excellent and it arrived very quickly! 
Kiah,Dering,10/6/1995,619, 5.0 , I bought this for my three year old daughter and although the website is a little old for her - she loves the dog and takes it everywhere with her.My eldest daughter loves the site and has played it for many years :) 
Kiah,Dering,10/6/1995,620, 5.0 , Okay so for a start the pug you actually receive looks nothing like the one on the picture. Mine was sitting down unlike this one and it was a whole lot smaller than what I expected after looking at the measurements provided in the description. Having said this the dog is still very cute and probably just as nice as the one pictured so I wasnt too annoyed when it arrived looking rather different. It is very soft and I love the fact you can play online as you dont get this opportunity with most other soft toy purchases - a nice touch! So yeah bottom line is the pug is very cute and cuddly just dont expect it to look the same as the picture shows at least mine didnt anyway! 
Kiah,Dering,10/6/1995,621, 5.0 , Gorgeous and Soft Puggy Soft Toy very happy with the purchase. Bought for a friends baby however I think I might order another for myself. 
Kiah,Dering,10/6/1995,622, 5.0 , I brought this toy for a child in the family. Went down a treat. Safe & soft for kidz. Good buy. Looks better than in the picture. 
Adriana,Castelow,8/13/1997,623, 5.0 , This was amazing!!!!!!item was very cute when received!!if you/family members love pugs then this is what is right for them 
Adriana,Castelow,8/13/1997,624, 5.0 , very good buy i like it would buy again thank u for this i let others no to buy one 
Adriana,Castelow,8/13/1997,625, 4.0 , My young Grand-daughter has got a thing about pugs but she is unable to have a dog. I got this for her as a gift and was really pleased it really looks like a pug. She loves it. Good choice of gift. It arrived in time and well packed.
Adriana,Castelow,8/13/1997,626, 5.0 , I love it the kids love it and their friends love it.

Shell,Feechum,5/10/1979,634, 4.0 , Perfect gift for my grandson. You know youre getting quality with the name and you wont be disappointed. Looks like hes got a real personality. 10/10. 
Shell,Feechum,5/10/1979,635, 5.0 , My wife was very happy with this little prezzi very quick delivery and being steif you know it is a quality bit of kit very happy. 
Shell,Feechum,5/10/1979,636, 3.0 , Delivered with in a few days. Lovely material very soft and cuddly.Steiff are supposed to be the best bear makersBut I did feel the stitching wasnt great on the face.So expensive for a beat thats not finished to a high standard. 
Shell,Feechum,5/10/1979,637, 5.0 , I actually bought this bear for my dads 50th birthday after he mentioned one time he doesnt have a teddy. The fact that he sits it on his pillow every single morning when he leaves for work has shown me just how much he loves it. He said its brought back memories from his childhood and it really is a lovely soft bear. Great for all ages :) 
Shell,Feechum,5/10/1979,638, 5.0 , He is everything I hoped for.  As a special present for my grand daughter she is thrilled with him and something she will always keep and treasure as a momento of her 18th Birthday.  Never too old for a teddy bear especially a Steiff. 
Shell,Feechum,5/10/1979,639, 5.0 , A delightful small Ted - so cute actually we also bought the cream coloured Ted too! My five-year-old daughter was delighted. I wish I had had a bear like this when I was little. 
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,640, 5.0 , Hard to buy a Steiff bear at such a reasonable price Babys seem to be popping out everywhere in the family and this went down very well. fast delivery and highly rated.
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,641, 5.0 , Have real ones are cuter but this is perfect quality and life like
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,642, 4.0 , I bought this to torment my teenage niece who has a much-treasured lamb quite like it.  This now allows an increase in the activities. 
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,643, 5.0 , Perfect!
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,644, 4.0 , I bought two of these Steiff teddies for Christmas - one for a 1 year old and the other for a 2 year old.The girls seem to love them as they are small and very cuddly like a plush toy. But beware - I hadnt really appreciated how small 18cms is so was disappointed when they arrived. So while theyre probably a good size for small children they may not be so great for older ones.The other disappointing thing was the packaging - or lack of it. The teddies were in plastic bags (good idea while in a warehouse) so I had to find more suitable packaging (boxes) for presentation.Im trusting Steiff to have produced something thats robust (my 29 year old still has his which he was given at 1 year old) rather than just a collectors item - hence the 5 stars for durability. Only time will tell.Ive marked fun and educational with 3 stars because a teddy probably doesnt deliver either of these in comparison to other toys.But its a nice bear well made and begs to be cuddled. 
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,645, 2.0 , I bought this as a present for a child’s birthday present and didn’t look at it until the day. So I was unable to return it as I didnt have time to buy another present. I was really disappointed to see one leg was a lot longer than the other I took photos of this. So I am not convinced the teddy is a genuine steiff bear! I am not sure if one leg is meant to be longer but it really did not look right! 
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,646, 5.0 , Bought this for my daughter who is going abroad for a year to study languages great size for travel!  He is so cute and I am sure will keep her company when feeling home sick.  As usual it is made to a high standard and I hope she will have it for many years to come and maybe pass it on to one of her children and who knows it may become a collectors item of the future.  Very pleased with it and with service from the seller.  It is smallish but wanted that size to fit in her suitcase. 
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,647, 5.0 , Hes wonderful teddy. I didnt know that Steiff did little teddy s he has a new owner hes a tiny twin .So buying a Steiff you know that they are safe. 
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,648, 3.0 , Not sure how to rate this...second bear is great but first turned up without the famous yellow tag in its ear! Not sure who to blame for that! 
Law,Collymore,10/20/1991,649, 5.0 , as always impossible to go wrong with a Steiff bear.  i have previously ordered bears from you for a friend and he has always been delighted. 
Dulcinea,Barts,10/27/1963,650, 5.0 , The perfect first steiff bear for any small child. The perfect Christmas present for your little one. Great price packaging and delivery. 
Brittan,Starmer,4/13/1947,651, 5.0 , Very happy with my purchase and the tiny bears seemed appropriate for tiny premature new-borns.  I think they should be publicised more.
Francklyn,Filby,2/17/2003,652, 5.0 , Believe or not our 22 year old daughter wanted a cuddly sloth for a present but there arent many around until we spotted this one.  Delivery was excellent and it arrived well packaged.  It is certainly cute and well made just the right size too.  5 star rating given for quality service delivery and cuteness! 
Francklyn,Filby,2/17/2003,653, 4.0 , This sloth has found a new home with my son.  It keeps him company whilst he is doing his homework. Just small enough to perch on a bookcase shelf or desk or sit on your shoulder. Doesnt require much feeding so very economical in that way. My only niggle is that my son did initially say that the sloth looked like a bear in a wetsuit!
Francklyn,Filby,2/17/2003,654, 5.0 , Bought this 9 beanie for my sister for Easter - it is gorgeous quick delivery from the seller would highly recommend both. 
Francklyn,Filby,2/17/2003,655, 5.0 , Cute one.
Francklyn,Filby,2/17/2003,656, 5.0 , These dolls are perfect for my little girls ( I also got the Ellie doll too) They are perfectly sized for cuddling up to and the quality is really good. I will be getting some more to give as presents for my niece and god daughters this Christmas. 
Francklyn,Filby,2/17/2003,657, 5.0 , I love love love LOVE this not only is she an absolutely gorgeous doll shes great for cold nights and tummy aches 
Isidoro,Avrashin,3/22/1996,658, 5.0 , These dolls are gorgeous and so well made. I have purchased 2 dolls one for each of my daughters for an easter gift. We go on holiday in our caravan a lot so thought these would be excellent to warm them up in bed and cuddle up to aswell. 
Isidoro,Avrashin,3/22/1996,659, 5.0 , This is lovely. Ive bought it to put away for Christmas and the cupboard I stashed it in smells gorgeous because of this doll! It is a good size and weight and looks made to last. I think the colours hair etc. actually look better than in the product picture. Delivery was very quick too! 
Isidoro,Avrashin,3/22/1996,660, 5.0 , I absolutely love this rag doll. So much so that I went on to buy three more as Christmas gifts. The quality is very good and shes a good size for both putting in the microwave and for snuggles. Shame Im not 6 again else Id want one for me!..... 
Isidoro,Avrashin,3/22/1996,661, 4.0 , All I can say is that the doll looks lovely. It is a Christmas present for my granddaughter and my daughter thought it would be great because my granddaughter loves to cuddle dolls and may actually go to sleep better... Obviously it hasnt been used just yet until Santa has been... 
Isidoro,Avrashin,3/22/1996,662, 4.0 , If you dont like the smell of lavender it isnt for you! Other than that shes fine. She has a decent weight so can offer your child comfort on a night and gets lovely and toasty. I leave Ellie on a radiator before bed instead of the microwave as you get a more even warmth. 
Zarah,Papa,5/22/1985,663, 5.0 , A birthday present for my granddaughter and she loves it. It is especially loved when she is feeling poorly and it is nice and warm in her bed.Well made and sure to be loved by girls of all ages. Even mum gets to cuddle it when she has mummy pains.
Zarah,Papa,5/22/1985,664, 5.0 , Bought this as a fun desktop companion for a chameleon lover. Does a good job of sitting aroung near the computer looking cuddly quite sturdy as well. Should last a while as long as it doesnt see too much action from a lively child!
Zarah,Papa,5/22/1985,665, 5.0 , My 4 yr old loves this and likes to take it for walks and stroke it. So much nicer than the more expensive toys that walk themselves. The lead was a particular appeal for my daughter.Lovely quality and well made. 
Zarah,Papa,5/22/1985,666, 4.0 , soft plush and luxurious to the touch. cute and cuddly and made to last. It would have worked even better with a longer lead but happy with what was provided 
Zarah,Papa,5/22/1985,667, 5.0 , I am pleased with this purchase. My 5yo daughter saw these somewhere and asked for one specifically. So we have a dalmation one for her and a labrador for her 3yo sister. They are good quality given the fairly low price point. The leads are fairly short (29cm) but this is probably fine for small children. Will make a nice xmas present. Would recommend. 
Zarah,Papa,5/22/1985,668, 5.0 , My daughter loves it 
Zarah,Papa,5/22/1985,669, 3.0 , This will be a present for our granddaughter so dont know how she will respond but it is very cute. Cannot understand why the lead is so short!  Why make it so short is it really saving that much not to use a bit more plastic?My husband is pretty clever and has managed to make a new longer leather lead which will work so much better.
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,670, 5.0 , Adorable little owl that made the perfect present for a loved one. Colour was pretty much exactly as it looks in the picture. And is perfectly cuddle sized. Another TY success. Delivered quickly in an adequately sized bag. 
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,671, 5.0 , Fab loved by my 3year old nephew wed visited the local owl sanctuary and I got his this cute little owl as a reminder of our day. X 
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,672, 5.0 , bought for my daughter who has a bit of a beanie boo fanatic. she wanted this one mainly because of the freaky colour scheme. 
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,673, 2.0 , This is a present for a collector of Ty Bears so I am very disappointed that the Ty name tag is not attached to the owl. 
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,674, 5.0 , Excellent product great condition and one very happy daughter!!
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,675, 5.0 , The boy loves it - well made not big but good quality
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,676, 5.0 , Great item!Arrived in excellent condition.
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,677, 4.0 , This was a filler present for my boyfriend. It is quite stiff so has cracked slightly over time but sits on his desk and looks great as well as providing a little stress relief.
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,678, 5.0 , I bought this to extend my daughters collection of blue noses and the quality and reasonable price was as expected.Fast delivery also. 
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,679, 5.0 , Lovely item for children and collectors alike Nice for pram toys. baby cuddles up to this all the time. Nice 
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,680, 5.0 , I want to keep this for myself! 
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,681, 5.0 , Brilliant 
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,682, 4.0 , Add to my Daughters collection! One of the better ones! :-)Good character to add to the blue nose friends set.
Tymon,Cottam,3/16/1974,683, 5.0 , Lets be honest choosing the right Despicable Me unicorn could make or break Christmas if your kids are as unicorn-mad as ours... and its so hard to tell from the photos and description (and reviews!) which is the right one to choose.  The eagle-eyed parent might spot that some makes have ears and/or eyes that are more consistent with the movie whilst other designs seem more or less fluffy... so we decided to choose fluffy over eye and ear accuracy and we are glad we did.  This unicorn is super soft and fluffy much more like a typical soft pillow pets toy than say a Ty-style plush toy that tends to be firmer and more velvet texture than soft fluff... after all you can hardly scream its so FLUFFY! on Christmas morning if its not fluffy!(For the record we bought ours from Kizrr - it looks exactly like the photo and it was posted from the UK by 1st class mail excellent service! :-) 
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,684, 5.0 , Bought this toy for a friends little girl. Both her and her dad are big fans of the movies and she was delighted when she unwrapped it! Never goes anywhere without it now :) 
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,685, 5.0 , Love love love it.  Soooo cute.  Daughter loved it on her birthday.  Other two kids want one now!!! 
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,686, 5.0 , Brilliant item. Exactly as described. Seller was fantastic dispatched and delivered very quickly.
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,687, 5.0 , official ty product cute and ...well what else is there to say?  its melman/melmin its only the giraffe from Madagascar!
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,688, 5.0 , Girlfriend loves it
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,689, 5.0 , Product was not as described however seller contacted me and I went ahead with the purchase. I was really pleased I did as the beanie bear I got is lovely it was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,690, 5.0 , Really good quality. I bought it for my 4 month old nephew and he loves it. He cant stop smiling whenever he sees Luigi. Little tip: You can actually take his hoodie off by simply cutting the stitch in between his eyebrows. The stitch only holds the hoodie so dont worry about ruining the toy. He actually has hair under it.
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,691, 5.0 , Bought as a present for Christmas looks lovely so am sure the grand daughter will love it 
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,692, 5.0 , brill
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,693, 5.0 , we bought this item to raffle for breast cancer wear it pink day and everyone fell in  love with her and wanted to take her home she is adorable and raised £23 for breast cancer. 
Myca,Bluschke,8/17/1951,694, 5.0 , I bought this for my 3 year old becuase her nusery class is called flamingos. She loves it and goes to bed with it every night. Good toy well worth the money. 
Frank,Karppi,11/12/1995,695, 5.0 , Lovely plush toy... really soft. .. very well made. ..  well worth the money. .. my daughter will love it... Thank you...
Frank,Karppi,11/12/1995,696, 5.0 , Very well made soft toy and has become the mother of a pact that my daughter now has. Excwllwnt quality and good value for the money. 
Frank,Karppi,11/12/1995,697, 4.0 , Really plush and well  made - bought it for my daughter whos fiance has a wolf tattoo as a fun engagement gift - she loved it! 
Frank,Karppi,11/12/1995,698, 5.0 , Very happy with this wolf. I bought it to go with a wolf adoption for my grandsons Christmas present.  He loved it. 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,699, 5.0 , Kids love it!
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,700, 3.0 , I was really disappointed with this when it arrived - it wasnt very well finished and it wasnt particularly nice to handle - its rather stiff and hard (I guess because it needs to be able to stand up!) I nearly sent it back but it was a birthday gift and there was no time to buy something else. Just goes to show I know nothing! The little girl who received it totally loves it. Its been to school to bed and even has its own lead and collar now. Her mum thinks its a great substitute for a real pet dog too! 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,701, 5.0 , I just knew I had purchased a good looking doggie for our godchild when I saw a local pet shop displaying dog coats on this little fellow. (It still had its Melissa & Doug label attached!)It was just so life like. The seven year old recipient was also delighted with her new pet and has taken it around with her everywhere. Even her Mummy had trouble putting it down it was so cute. I bought a puppy collar & lead for it as I felt she would like that and made a blanket for it to sleep on so I guess the new addition will be really at home and taken care of very well.So if you are thinking of a pet substitute for a child not allowed any who might also have  allergies I would recommend this very highly. It is not all soft and mushy but has a very lifelike quality that a child over five would enjoy. 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,702, 5.0 , As part of my job I visit schools to teach children about looking after dogs and staying safe around dogs (including greeting a dog appropriately and behaviour around dogs that are eating in their bed etc.). I had a border collie (of unknown brand!) helping me out but poor Shep got a few holes in his belly and was bleeding polystyrene beans plus was a bit bulky for getting on the bus so he has now gone into retirement.Patch is the new pup and is absolutely fantastic. My only concern is that being predominantly white he might get grubby then I will have to test how well he washes up. But it is a very realistic Jack Russell size shape and colour - he even has dark rings around his eyes - and I have been stopped and asked is that real? even by adults - personally I think that although realistic its still fairly obviously a toy! It has a very solidly stuffed body and a stiff wire frame despite other reviews I find mine doesnt pose well and pings back into the standing shape but I am happy with that.If Im nit picking one of the seams along a back paw wasnt finished properly but it was such a tiny fault as to be unnoticeable.This is not really a toy to snuggle up in bed with but if you are after a realistic looking toy dog you wont go far wrong with one of Melissa and Dougs. 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,703, 5.0 , This dog is brilliant - its lifesize very realistic and very sturdy.  It has a wire frame inside which means that it can stand up or can be posed for example to sit down - well worth the money. 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,704, 5.0 , My daughters were delighted when this toy arrived. It is very lifelike. It is firm and can be posed. It can be cuddled but is not soft. Great for dog lovers. Our Jack Russells thought it was real! 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,705, 5.0 , Imagine a teenager seeing a naked women for the first time - this is how my 1+ year old daughter reacts to dogs when she sees them. She has a few cartoony soft dogs but none of them make her as happy as real dogs do. So it was a logical choice for me to buy a life-like soft toy and I must say the reaction was more than positive. She was playing with her a lot yesterday so Im happy. The dog itself is really nice - looks a lot like a real thing and the size is perfect. It seem to have a skeleton so it stands perfectly even when my daughter is hugging the creature. Its way better than a real dog for me - I like cats way more (and dont like pets in general) so the fact that I dont have to walk it out makes me happy. I also noticed that Melissa & Doug make a 1.2 meter tall giraffe - will probably buy one too. The quality is really good. 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,706, 5.0 , This dog was bought in June 2015 as Companion for my Westie as he suffers with separation anxiety.  He LOVES it every night.  He also plays with it shaking it by the legs and will share his chair with it.  Considering the hard wear my dog puts it through it is still in very good condition only needs a wipe over with a damp cloth to bring it up to new looking.  Would but again if I found it necessary but at this rate I dont think I will for a long time.  Very good buy. 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,707, 2.0 , I bought this on the strength of the reviews and I was not impressed.  It was a good size and not too hard to the touch.  The seems were poorly finished were brown bits in the white and seems very obvious.  My main problem with it was one leg was shorter than the others so it looked like it was cocking its leg. Ive never had one of these before so is it supposed to be like that? Impression of movement or something?  Sorry not a good look.
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,708, 5.0 , hes going on holiday soon!
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,709, 5.0 , I bought this elephant for my 25 year old boyfriend for Christmas! He loves it :-p 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,710, 5.0 , Totally fabulous! Soft gorgeous and daughter loves it! 
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,711, 5.0 , Brilliant
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,712, 5.0 , My kids love Yoohoos!  And this one is super cute!
Ezequiel,Scholig,1/20/1964,713, 5.0 , So soft and can stand or sit. Great quality and won over my 3 year old godson even though he was slightly poorly :)
Xaviera,Shade,11/13/1953,714, 4.0 , Arrived on time and toy is as expected. 
Xaviera,Shade,11/13/1953,715, 5.0 , Exactly what we expected! Awesome! 
Xaviera,Shade,11/13/1953,716, 5.0 , Very good
Xaviera,Shade,11/13/1953,717, 5.0 , This bear is a retired (no longer being made) TY beanie baby called Chinook.American TY Warner invented the first beanie baby in 1986.Each of his beanie babies has their own birthday.This beanies birthday is May 24th 2000.Also each beanie baby has its own heart shaped tag with a poem inside.The front of this tag reads TY 2000 and inside this tag this beanies poem reads:From this great land Ill never roamBeloved Canada is my homeHer maple leaf I proudly wearTo show the world how much I care!I only gave Chinook a 4 star durability rating because of his paper tag (if constantly read it wont last.)Chinook is surface washable and would make the perfect fun gift for a TY or bear lover or perhaps a Canadian friend. 
Xaviera,Shade,11/13/1953,718, 4.0 , Good quality bear but was smaller than anticipated. I posted it to friends in France (from a uk address) and it ended up costing me over £16.00.
Xaviera,Shade,11/13/1953,719, 5.0 , We bought the yellow on for my son when he was a year old we call him sunshine because these toys light up the room! No one can be grumpy with one around the sound is not unpleasant or obnoxious like so many other baby toys which is important for the parents when its on for ages! The button is great once activated the lightest movement is rewarded with happy sounds. We bought this for my 4 month old who is wide eyes when she bashes it with her fist :)
Xaviera,Shade,11/13/1953,720, 5.0 , This make tends to be on the small size for Build a Bear bears but this product  even though the trousers are short waisted  and light for our Build a Bear  the material and workmanship is great. 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,721, 5.0 , Lovely set! Very pleased with the quality. 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,722, 5.0 , simply beautiful tyvm
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,723, 5.0 , I got this for a friend who was freaked out by the movie and was a great idea to get him one. He loved it. Well actually he was feaked out. As this was the desired effect i consider the gift a success. 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,724, 4.0 , A cuddly facehugger my granddaughter loved it. Who needs a snuggle bunny when youve got one of these. Only thing is the bendy arms could be a lot more bendy. 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,725, 4.0 , This is an excellent prop / collectors item for any fans of the Alien films. The material does an great job of representing the look of the facehuggers in the films. My only (minor) criticisms would be that although the legs are posable you cant actually bend them enough to hug your head & the tail is slightly chunkier at the base than in the films. Delightfully creepy to have around the house! 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,726, 5.0 , Fully posable legs great for themed photos or just as an Alien prop to have lying around your house. Quick delivery good quality product. 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,727, 4.0 , A fantastic plush toy good quality overall with bendy legs and tail. I cant keep the kids away from it maybe one day I will tell them what the facehugger actually is and does. 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,728, 3.0 , Bigger than expected which is good seems good quality fast delivery. Only downside as others have said it DOES NOT hug the face or hold on at all so disappointing. 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,729, 5.0 , despite being horrible it was loved by the not so small boy who recieved it and arrived in good time 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,730, 1.0 , Shocking item - no detail and looks like a rude teddy!!! extremely bad value for money and sent straight back - cant believe this can be associated with the alien brand!! dont buy otherwise I will be saying I told you so!
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,731, 5.0 , Wow! This is absolutely excellent. Lovely quality. Great design. Great priced and great seller. Isabelle looks lovely and just like you see her on animal crossing and her bell also dings. Am very happy with this. Well worth the money and I highly recommend this. My little girl is going too be very pleased when she sees she has this on Christmas morning. Excellent. Thankyou so much!:) 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,732, 5.0 , This was a gift for an Animal Crossing fan who loved it. He says its very accurate to the game and adorable. He did mention that Isabelles legs are in an odd position underneath her - theyre attached to the front edge of her torso so she can only really sit. 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,733, 5.0 , This Item Arrived Quick And It Is A Love For All Ages!One Thing Is That The Bells On Her Headband Are Real And Can Get Annoying. However It Is An Amazing Price And Its Worth All The Money!I Hope You Buy As You Will Never Want To Let Go! 
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,734, 5.0 , Perfect! exactly as she is in the game!
Hynda,Simenet,12/17/1947,735, 5.0 , arrived the next day.Very good quality the plastic outer layer is good and easy to clean.got it for my daughters birthday she  loved it good quality great product.very happy with it thanks 
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,736, 5.0 , Perfect little messenger bag for my 3 year old daughter its cute design and well made.Bought for my daughter to store her leap reader and books in and its perfect 
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,737, 5.0 , My 6-year old niece LOVED this bag which was bought as a birthday present. I cant imagine any other little girls of a similar age who wouldnt feel the same!! :0) 
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,738, 4.0 , Good product for the price. appears sturdy and easy to clean which is great for primary age school children to carry their reading books.
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,739, 5.0 , Perfect gift for my son who loves plants vs zombies. With quick delivery in time for xmas

Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,741, 5.0 , great toy arrived promptly. Daughter loves! 
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,742, 5.0 , Great product
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,743, 5.0 , These bears all look as though they have different characteristics.  Very soft Would be able to handle wear and tear.  Good for presenting in gift baskets as they are not too tall or short.
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,744, 5.0 , Huge plush i love it! First one had to go back as the eye was damaged! They are plastic. I doubt they would break with a little one playing with it but it did have a sharp egde when it was broken. Delivery was fast! A few working days :-) 
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,745, 5.0 , Hes So Fluffy Im Gonna Die! Hes also huge! nearly half my size. Seems well made - will see how he survives a Halloween party though... 
Christen,Scranney,7/28/1946,746, 3.0 , Good quality etc but its not fluffy which is rather disappointing.
Layla,Annable,8/4/1989,747, 5.0 , I bought 4 beanie cats for my 7 year old daughter who plays endlessly with them takes them to school and plays with her friends with them (who have similar toys but not as nice!).  I suppose the cats in themselves arent educational but so what! she enjoys them and using her own imagination has endless little fantasy scenarios with them and with her friends.  The delivery was rapid they wash well are small enough for pockets and school bags and whilst my daughter is more interested in how cute they are I appreciate the accuracy of the different cat breeds represented.
Layla,Annable,8/4/1989,748, 5.0 , i got this item sooner that what i was expecting and in perfect state...great tor the quality and the price. 
Layla,Annable,8/4/1989,749, 5.0 , This is a small little champion of champions really lovely finish and a real bargain in my opinion and is now on its way to be with our new born grandson in Auastralia so how good is that to be able to find this on the otherside of the world means quite a lot to us !! 
Layla,Annable,8/4/1989,750, 3.0 , Lovely little bear but little being the word. If buying as a gift its more of a stocking filler or anadd on gift. Although still very nice 
Layla,Annable,8/4/1989,751, 5.0 , I brought this Koala for my daughter for her birthday. She loves anything to do with Australia and this was ideal. Good quality 
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,752, 5.0 , This came well wrapped and protected and was as advertised. It arrived in the time promised and did not disappoint at all. 
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,753, 5.0 , I was delighted with the koalas. They were just what I was looking for. Their condition  expressions were extremely good 
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,754, 5.0 , As expected arrived well within  dates well packaged  lovely little thing just what I wanted 
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,755, 5.0 , Arrived the next day even though didnt request next dayperfect lovely made toy.
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,756, 5.0 , American daughter-in-law visited England and saw sheep - fell in love with them!She loved the soft toys I sent 
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,757, 5.0 , All exactly as described including delivery. Thx
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,758, 5.0 , IT was here next day#We were taking a teddy bear to Chicago for a joke.  The thing he didnt have was a passport so I sent for this for him.  Great for a wee bear who plans to travel the world.
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,759, 4.0 , Good quality mug. Sadly the interior is very easily stained by tea and coffee to the extent that normal washing doesnt clean it. It has to be bleached to remove the stains. Otherwise its fine. 
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,760, 5.0 , Bought for my grandson. Good quality and at the right price he loves it which is the really important thing.
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,761, 5.0 , Great looks good bigger than it looks fast delivery 
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,762, 5.0 , Lovely toy
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,763, 5.0 , Service excellent well packaged and delivery on time.  Product really good quality very pleased - would definitely recommend this purchase - very cute and well worth the money. 
Mark,Calcraft,10/24/1961,764, 5.0 , Delightful cuddly Owl given as a gift to our Grand Daughter. Looks well made and durable. 
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,765, 5.0 , Just beautiful! So soft I love it quality
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,766, 5.0 , Loved this item.  Bought as a present for my Grandchild the parents were very pleased with the Bear.  A toy that brings pleasure and comfort - would definitely purchase again.
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,767, 5.0 , This  beanie baby is very engaging! It was given to me as a gift and I love its brave little face.I am very fond of most of the beanie babies but I think I like Charmer the best. So do my youngest grandaughters.Charmer is very soft and cuddly an ideal bed fellow for little girls who are not quite sure if they are afraid of the dark or not yet. Comforting to hold and I am reliably informed  that Charmer keeps the spooks at bay. 
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,768, 4.0 , this looks very nice but the horn is different to the picture its different colours instead of gold. but it arrived in good condition and my daughter will like it.
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,769, 4.0 , This Dog is a retired (no longer being made) TY beanie baby called Houston.Each beanie baby has their own birthday this beanies birthday is November 17th 2005.Also each beanie baby has its own heart shaped tag with a poem inside.The front of this tag reads TY ORIGINAL BEANIE BABIES and inside this tag this beanies poem reads:I just got some brand new toysAnd they make different kinds of noiseThe best thing bout these toys I seeIs that they all are just for me!I only gave Houston a 4 star durability rating because of his paper tag (if its constantly read it wont last.)Houston is surface washable and would make the perfect fun gift for a TY or Dog lover.
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,770, 4.0 , We first purchase the 32cm version from Amazon which was nothing like the photo shown either on Amazon or the Seiff website where the photo seems to be the same one for both sizes of bear. It looked smaller thinner and not so attractive. We returned it immediately for an instant refund from Amazon which was very swift and efficiently handled.Having done a lot more research online we finally decided to order the 40cm version from Amazon not quite sure what we’d get.What we got was a better balanced and cuddly bear (than the 32cm) which was closer to the one shown in the photo but looked like he’d grown up a bit. (see my photos) I can only think that the photo shown of Elmar on the Stiff and Amazon website is of an earlier version. The proportions are all wrong most noticeably the eyes on the latest version are smaller that said he is adorable and will be cherished by our new grandson. It just would be nice if hed matched the picture.There are a number of comments about if the versions shown on Amazon are genuine as they come in a plastic bag well they are tagged and individually numbered so I have no doubt genuine Stiff. If you want the box (which doesn’t seem very exciting and is worth £3.95) buy your bear direct from Steiff.Overall height of bear sitting is 29cm something we couldn’t find out anywhere.Also both the 32cm and 40cm versions have a bulge at the top of his neck which apparently is normal. 
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,771, 4.0 , I bought this bear to celebrate the arrival of  the first baby of my wifes daughter who lives in Florence.  I chose this as a gift as a novelty as the traditional English teddy  is unknown in Italy. I have never forgotten how I loved my Steiff teddy bear as a child. Mine must have been second hand as I grew up in England during WWII when there was no trade with Germany where these traditional toys have always been made by hand. I looked at several models in the Steiff range and selected this one as it is claimed to be machine washable although I thought it rather expensive. All I can say at this stage is that the babys mother fell in love with it at first sight - just like I did 70 years ago so what does the expense matter! 
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,772, 5.0 , I bought this as a Christening present for my God Son. He was immediately enamoured with Elmar as was everyone else in the room especially when they found out he was machine washable!A very well received present I highly recommend him. 
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,773, 5.0 , Beautiful steiff bear bought as a present for my big sister...everyone loves a bear on their bed! Ive added a grey ribbon just to finish him off and to match her colour scheme!....fantastic service from Amazon superior to Hamleys who could not even put the two original orders through for this bear....thank you x 
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,774, 5.0 , This is the fourth Elmar bear Ive purchased for a succession of grandchildren and they never fail to disappoint. Their traditional look and so soft covering make them ideal for babies and children. Its worth paying that little bit extra for a good quality bear. 
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,775, 5.0 , What a fabulous buy!  Quality always shows and this Steiff Bear is just delightful!!  When I saw it I just could not resist buying it!!  My wife absolutely adores it - I bought it for her 67th birthday!!  Thanks a Million Amazon and Steiff!! 
Chad,Yielding,10/23/1997,776, 5.0 , Gorgeus bear my 4 month old loves it! They are not the cheapest teddies going however the quality is superb and looks amazing. Very soft and huggable! 
Cher,Gatenby,5/18/1950,777, 5.0 , Brilliant Bear soft and just the right size children loved him and he looks like the bear in the Show me Show me childrens programme.  He looks exactly the same as the Teddington Bear so I dressed him in a waistcoat and hes perfect most importantly washable! I bought 2
Cher,Gatenby,5/18/1950,778, 4.0 , Very happy and came on time
Cher,Gatenby,5/18/1950,779, 1.0 , These are smaller than than you think and a little over priced worth about £5  they make an annoying sound and stick their tongue out im sure kids will love them anyway they look more fun in the advert than they actually are the one that I received had an arm missing amazon are replacing the product but I now have the trouble of sending the faulty one back. 
Cher,Gatenby,5/18/1950,780, 4.0 , I like this toy as a stocking filler type. Its noisy & silly which is part of the fun. I have just received the pink cat one for my 18 month old and think she will find it highly entertaining. Ideally I would of like to pay about £6 for this toy but ended up paying £10. 
Cher,Gatenby,5/18/1950,781, 5.0 , Total enjoyment for my granddaughter without the use of batteries unseen before by a number of her friends. 
Cher,Gatenby,5/18/1950,782, 5.0 , Part of my granddaughter s Christmas presents which I am sure she will love

It is very soft very good quality and good value for money. Comes with a name badge on his collar. Arrived three days after ordering - good service thank you. 
Cher,Gatenby,5/18/1950,784, 5.0 , I brought this last minute at Xmas as my daughter of 6yrs added aspotty dog to her list. Lovely little article well made and still going strong!

Kelcie,Longfield,1/20/1998,800, 5.0 , Beautifully madewith all the detail you get from a Ty Beanie Baby. Lovelyvibrant colourwith the Welsh flag embriodered on its sidethis dragon is a welcome addition to any Beanie collection.

Kelcie,Longfield,1/20/1998,805, 5.0 , This lovely little chimp is by Keel Toys & from Eastburn General Stores & is a well made little character with a lovely expression.  Very soft fur & filling.  Im very pleased with him & the price paid for his purchase a bargain from Eastburn via Amazon as he is more expensive from any other suppliers Ive checked on eBay.  He will make a lovely stocking filler for my granddaughter nicknamed The Chimp. 
Vladimir,Antonioni,10/3/1984,806, 5.0 , My deluxe chimp was just gorgeous - excellent quality and great value - so impressed I ordered a second one 
Vladimir,Antonioni,10/3/1984,807, 5.0 , I bought this as a present for my niece. Its a really cute chimpanzee toy very soft material and perfect for her to play with & cuddle. Very good value for money quick delivery & good service all round. 
Vladimir,Antonioni,10/3/1984,808, 5.0 , Great item. Bought for a little girl age 6 who is monkey crazy. She loves him. Just the rite size for a child to cuddle. Fast delivery and easy straight forward purchase. Would recommend. 
Vladimir,Antonioni,10/3/1984,809, 2.0 , sorry to say I thought this looked really cute and a nice stocking filler but the plush is coming apart and I keep getting clumps of it in my hands.  I should have returned it really.  Luckily it wasnt the only cuddly toy my daughter was given for Christmas but this is not very good quality.  I certainly wouldnt recommend it for a baby or any child under 2. 
Vladimir,Antonioni,10/3/1984,810, 5.0 , Bought this as my daughter is going through a Tarzan phase. It was as described and feels quite nice to hold. Ideal bedtime companion for the little ones.
Vladimir,Antonioni,10/3/1984,811, 5.0 , its going to make a really lovely Christmas present and it was delivered the next day
Vladimir,Antonioni,10/3/1984,812, 4.0 , When it arrived it had several miss-stitches on the face but those where easily removed otherwise perfectly acceptable postage was every good arrived with no hassle! Also price was very good!

Belinda,Hinrich,3/28/1951,824, 5.0 , Great product super speedy delivery.  Thank you
Belinda,Hinrich,3/28/1951,825, 5.0 , These bears are really great and actually I think very good value for money think how much a cheap bear costs and then compare the small amount extra to get this top quality bear theres no comparison at all. Sometimes you just need to spend a little bit more just like good coffee.
Belinda,Hinrich,3/28/1951,826, 5.0 , I chose this rating because to be truthful I really did love it and more important so did the person I bought it forI liked the time it took to deliver it and also I liked the price and the quality of the item.I would recommend this item to my family and friends in the knowledge it would be liked. 
Belinda,Hinrich,3/28/1951,827, 5.0 , Came really quick which was good as bought as a gift and is really fluffy. 8 year old girl loves it!!

Netty,Witz,8/2/1998,833, 5.0 , Great very soft and fab colour.
Gnni,Balentyne,8/28/1996,834, 5.0 , When I received my plush through the post I was shocked at how small it was. Yes yes I know there are measurements there but purely because I didnt order it from this website I didnt get to see those and going purely on the picture alone it looks quite big.The plush is cute and would be suitable for someone who enjoys the manga/anime series. However there is a warning on it that it contains small parts and not suitable for under 15s ok....under 15s is a new one :D But yeah the little pieces could easily come off so I would be wary about giving it to a small child. 
Gnni,Balentyne,8/28/1996,835, 5.0 , You can tell from the moment you open the item the quality is really there the item is clearly handmade and great plushie of ryuk. I brought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend as she loves Ryuk and after much browsing this is easily the best quality I have found. Well worth the money! I highly suggest this product! 
Gnni,Balentyne,8/28/1996,836, 5.0 , I bought this for my mother who is a big fan of Ryuk from Death Note. It arrived way before the estimated date and i was shocked with just how good the quality was. Its not large but its big enough. It looks pretty well made and my mum adores it! Heres a picture of the Ryuk we recieved c: 
Gnni,Balentyne,8/28/1996,837, 5.0 , I love this product.It arrived on time and is just amazing.Expected it to be a little bigger but it is still pretty awesome.Shall defiantly be buying from this seller again 
Gnni,Balentyne,8/28/1996,838, 5.0 , Superbly made!! Bought it as a gift i wanted to keep it myself!!
Gnni,Balentyne,8/28/1996,839, 5.0 , pleased with the quality good detail so guess this is why they seem a bit more expensive.Bought them to go with the Goki theatre which is quite small.Hope she likes them....... 
Gnni,Balentyne,8/28/1996,840, 5.0 , Lovely....omg they came so fast and I also ordered the soft stage....so worth the money. Cant wait for my daughter to open them on Christmas Day. Well done Amazon !!!!!
Gnni,Balentyne,8/28/1996,841, 5.0 , The product is excellent and arrived on time
Angelika,Culpen,4/6/1944,842, 5.0 , Love it and the embroidery makes it extra special.
Angelika,Culpen,4/6/1944,843, 3.0 , A very cute plush nice and big. DOES NOT come with stickers and mine arrived with the fur around its neck not glued or sewn down so quality is about a 6. 
Angelika,Culpen,4/6/1944,844, 5.0 , Oh my son loves this teddy sleeps with it thanks
Angelika,Culpen,4/6/1944,845, 5.0 , This Dog is a retired (no longer being made) TY beanie baby called Cargo.Each beanie baby has its own heart shaped tag with a poem inside.This beanies poem reads:Other dogs may like some kibbleNot me I wont even nibbleSo if you have some time to bakeId really like a chocolate cake!I only gave it a 4 star durability rating because of his paper tag (if its constantly being read it wont last.)Cargo is surface washable and would make the perfect gift for a Dog lover.
Angelika,Culpen,4/6/1944,846, 5.0 , I love it its my best teddy I have
Angelika,Culpen,4/6/1944,847, 5.0 , Fantastic product cute soft durable and safe. I purchased two puppies for my daughter (31 and 38cm) when she was 6 months old and they both soon became her most favorite toys. When she was teething she used to bite them quite a lot and both puppies stayed intact. This puppy is very easy to grab hold and hug for a little one. Now shes 16 months old calls them both Wow wow takes them everywhere walks them feeds them will not go to bed without them. The label says they should be hand washed but I put them couple of times through the washing machine and they came out absolutely fine. My daughter loves them and so do I. Excellent highly recommended soft toy. 
Angelika,Culpen,4/6/1944,848, 5.0 , Ahh its just lovely! Item arrived 4 days after despatch and intact. Well packaged. I deliberated for a long time about which Jellycat cuddly to get and after a long while I chose this little fella for my 9 month old. She loves him I love him and Im so impressed with the quality :) My toy clearly has a label thats states he is suitable from birth- fear not mummies!! 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,849, 5.0 , This is gorgeous. Really soft and beautiful quality. My English Pointer saw me holding it and thought wed got another pup. Ive had to hide it from him because he keeps taking it to his basket. 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,850, 5.0 , I purchased this teddy bear for my niece (18mths) for xmas. It arrived very quickly and in great condition. My niece loves this teddy and carries it around with her everywhere asking people to kiss it. Lovely teddy that could last for years! 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,851, 5.0 , All the jellycat toys we have for our children have been great - this is no exception for the latest addition would be better if it could rock the crib to get the baby to sleep though. 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,852, 5.0 , this was bought for my newborn son and its lovelyreally softfloppy and great to play with.id like one myself and im sure as my son grows this puppy will be a much loved toy
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,853, 5.0 , I know this is a prairie dog but I wanted to find a soft toy which looked like a degu to give to the children as they are degu fans. Anyway it is lovely and soft and very fit for purpose. My children also love the webkinz website so they will enjoy the soft toy and looking after it on the website.Very pleased with this prairie dog (degu for us :-) )Recommended 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,854, 4.0 , gave this as a gift and was well loved
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,855, 5.0 , good
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,856, 5.0 , My 7 year old god-daughter LOVES this! (My cat isnt so impressed.) It is sensitive to touch and makes a variety of revolting noises robust enough to survive a play session with three teenagers and a small girl and makes noises after youve finished playing with it; brilliant idea! 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,857, 4.0 , my partner bought the El Toro from a charity shop for our jack russell. he absolutely loved it so we wondered if you can get more.we saw this one and bought it and now he goes mad playing for it. i know it is meant for children but he enjoys it. 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,858, 5.0 , This toy is absolutely  superb  especially the sounds it makes and the delay in between the different  three sounds  -the fact my mother has only one tooth left had nothing to do with it  still she is only 88 !! 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,859, 3.0 , Canny stocking filler or something to spend pocket money on but not a patch on the larger Smasha-Ballz 
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,860, 5.0 , Bought for a boy with severe learning difficulties who adores anything that responds and makes a noise which he then copies! It will totally drive his Mum and Dad to distraction but will give a welcome break from our last gift. He has spent the last year yelling To infinity and beyond every time he enters a room thanks to our Buzz Lightyear pressie!!
Leigh,Davitashvili,4/23/1962,861, 5.0 , spot on just like the Charlie brown and snoopy versions
Ana,Kebell,3/12/1941,862, 5.0 , I myself have a weakness for foxes and was recommended to buy one of these. This was the same price as on the squishables website BUT benefited from my free Amazon prime delivery so I opted for this way instead. The box it came in was MASSIVE and I was actually surprised at the size of the thing (even though I knew in theory how wide he was). The squishy fox is made from the softest plushest (if that is not a word it is now) fur and is squishy and lovely to hold.I can imagine this would be a lovely toy for children to play with but honestly this is great to cuddle even as a grown man! My partner and I both enjoy giving it a squeeze and recommend this to any fox lovers out there. They also have a great range of other squishables with many different animals so have a look at those on Amazon! 
Ana,Kebell,3/12/1941,863, 5.0 , I chose this rating because I like this toy and for these reasons:Its size is suitable for someone like me (I am fairly small)  but if you are the toys loving adult it may be a little too small for you :DOtherwise its just perfect size for hugging.Its really fluffy enough soft etc.And I would recommend this toy for my forever alone friends or someone who is just lonely at nights. 
Ana,Kebell,3/12/1941,864, 5.0 , This product has the highest squish coefficient Ive ever seen and therefore is my favourite product. It also has very ruffly fur this is good. 
Ana,Kebell,3/12/1941,865, 5.0 , my daughter adores him; he is pretty cuddly!
Nara,Bromehed,3/2/1993,866, 5.0 , I had this ponies arrive in the post today and I must say Im delighted with them. Each of the Mane Six are show accurate nicely made and wonderful to look at. They are described as they are in the description and roughly would cost nearly £9 if bought individually but since youre getting six for £40 then that means you are getting each for just under £7 saving you about £10! A must have for any MLP young or old! =) 
Nara,Bromehed,3/2/1993,867, 5.0 , Worth the money! Daughter absolutely loves these! 
Nara,Bromehed,3/2/1993,868, 5.0 , Very happy. Thank you 
Nara,Bromehed,3/2/1993,869, 5.0 , great
Nara,Bromehed,3/2/1993,870, 5.0 , Item meets the impeccably high standards expected of a premium toy maker. All joints move as expected the material is extremely high quality and the stitching is spot-on. My sister was delighted to receive this as a present for her 21st.
Nara,Bromehed,3/2/1993,871, 5.0 , My husband bought this bear the day our daughter was born. It has been my daughters security ever since. We call this bear Bunny Bear. No matter how many times we wash it it holds up great. The  bears hat slips on and off so she loves to play peek a boo games which is a great way to hold their attention for several minutes or longer. Also the 8 size is perfect for your young children to hold in their hands while they are sleeping.I love this bear and so does my 2 year old daughter.
Maribel,Domoni,8/25/1958,872, 5.0 , The hair on the bear is soft and it has long arms so you can cuddle up with it during the night. i would recommend it for anyone who loves teddies.
Maribel,Domoni,8/25/1958,873, 4.0 , The gund characters have been a staple gift for my 1 year old niece for the past year. Snuffleupagus is the largest of the 12 range (being long rather than tall) them so far and lives in her cot. The gund toys are soft and cuddleable (except Oscar who is soft but because of the shine on his bin feels more plastic) 
Maribel,Domoni,8/25/1958,874, 5.0 , This is actually a gift for my husbands birthday because I call him Snuffleupagus. Its a beautiful quality toy and a good size a great thing to have and I know hell really love it. 
Tamra,Svanetti,4/11/1991,875, 5.0 , Present for a very happy lady. This is a fabulous gift for children from 6 to 60 has given joy and laughter to all who know why the gift was given.
Tamra,Svanetti,4/11/1991,876, 5.0 , Very pleased with this kit.  My granddaughter was very proud to show me the finished article.  I will be keeping any eye out for other kits which might be suitable.

Kennie,Quipp,9/18/1979,885, 5.0 , I DO LOVE IT SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT BUT ALPHIE THE DOG IS PLEASED
Kennie,Quipp,9/18/1979,886, 5.0 , I purchased this for my two year old granddaughter. She plays with them in conjunction with the Dear Zoo board book. The zoo animals are beautifully made with delightful faces true to the illustrations in the Dear Zoo books. The puppets are larger than I thought which makes them easier for the younger child to handle and recognise (and they are not so easily lost). Carers and siblings love to join in which add to the social aspects of learning.  The puppets are quite expensive but the originality and quality is excellent. The puppets are available on their own or with a soft case. The set with a case is around £7.00 more. The puppets minus case are around £18.99.  Well made soft and safe. Lots of imaginative play value. Lovely little animal toys that all young children will like. I would highly recommend this toy set 
Kennie,Quipp,9/18/1979,887, 5.0 , These are really well made products. They were purchased as a gift for my niece and shes going to love receiving them. Lots of play value. A really good buy.

Kennie,Quipp,9/18/1979,889, 5.0 , Great gift
Kennie,Quipp,9/18/1979,890, 5.0 , Arrived really quickly. Excellent service. I named him Jean-Claude after the vampire in the Anita Blake vampire hunter series by Laurel K Hamilton :-)
Kennie,Quipp,9/18/1979,891, 5.0 , I bought this toy for my Maine Coon kitten Sushi as a bed buddy. She absolutely adores it pouncing on it when lively and washing it when in a more sedate mood! It is very well made and looks as though it will survive many years of play and love. 
Chick,Bridges,10/27/1947,892, 5.0 , Super cute comfy to hold. 
Chick,Bridges,10/27/1947,893, 5.0 , This was very well received by someone who lost hers in Canada 2 years ago!
Chick,Bridges,10/27/1947,894, 4.0 , I am really happy to have Ed and Ein sat on my shelf in the living room! It is a bit smaller than I expected as the other reviewer noted. I think £9.99 is about the right price. Will be collecting more of these :)
Chick,Bridges,10/27/1947,895, 5.0 , i remember collecting digimon plush from mcdonalds about 14 years ago.i bought this item because i am collecting some digimon.
Chick,Bridges,10/27/1947,896, 5.0 , As described

Aliza,Fishenden,3/16/1971,902, 5.0 , Look sooooo realistic would recommend.
Aliza,Fishenden,3/16/1971,903, 4.0 , Arrived much sooner than expected and very cute. Will make a good present. The only thing that lets it down is that there is no presentation box or other packaging so the teddy seems a little squashed out of shape. I have time to correct that before my friends birthday but I shouldnt really need to. 
Aliza,Fishenden,3/16/1971,904, 3.0 , Disappointed with how this item looked when I received it. Looks better in the picture. 
Aliza,Fishenden,3/16/1971,905, 5.0 , My daughter loved this little bear. Perfect! ;D

Kerrin,Luckham,4/25/1976,910, 3.0 , Not the greatest quality. I had to sew her hair back on aftet inly a few days. 
Kerrin,Luckham,4/25/1976,911, 2.0 , I have bought this as a birthday gift for my son as he is Mario mad. To be honest I think these are ridiculously over priced for what they are. They are very small too. I would not have bought this but my son is desperate for it. Will be the last I buy though 
Kerrin,Luckham,4/25/1976,912, 5.0 , child loved it 
Kerrin,Luckham,4/25/1976,913, 1.0 , Rubbish stitching! Her crown wasnt even stitched on properly. Not even worth 50p 
Kerrin,Luckham,4/25/1976,914, 5.0 , My child was happy with this item quick delivery 
Kerrin,Luckham,4/25/1976,915, 5.0 , My son loves her thankyou

Burgess,Cuffley,12/8/1956,921, 4.0 , Different textiles used in toys always bemuses kids. Even adults are a big fan of them as they are colourful.
Burgess,Cuffley,12/8/1956,922, 5.0 , Bought this for my daughters third birthday as she loves despicable me the minions and the unicorn!  Ordered from the US and it arrived in plenty of time.  She loves all the phrases and the light up horn my 6yr old son is pretty impressed too!  A great product and very hard to find in the UK... 
Burgess,Cuffley,12/8/1956,923, 5.0 , My 6 year old granddaughter loved this. She has taken it everywhere she can since  she got it. I suppose it is a bit expensive but as its a Despicable Me toy you have to expect this. But for the look on her face when she openeded it it was well worth it. 
Burgess,Cuffley,12/8/1956,924, 5.0 , Excellent product.Bought for my daughter (5yrs old) and i was a bit skeptical. Saw a lot of ebay and amazon fluffysbut this one is strongly recommended.Obviously price is a bit high but product and service from seller are absolutely superb 
Robin,Rannie,1/22/1975,925, 4.0 , Bought this for my girlfriend who is a massive despicable me fan. The quotes are funny and its a very high quality built. Slightly smaller than I hoped for the price you pay bit this is only a slight negative. 
Robin,Rannie,1/22/1975,926, 5.0 , Grown up daughter was delighted. Good likeness good quality. Bought for Christmas and batteries still going. Let u make up ur own mind if thats a good or bad thing!!

Robin,Rannie,1/22/1975,929, 5.0 , Bought this for a gift and was appreciated its basically build ur own bear in a tin. Great gift idea!!
Robin,Rannie,1/22/1975,930, 5.0 , Bought this for a young lady sitting very stressful exams. Panda was incredibly soft and very cuddly found it a real wrench to actually give it away. Recommend it for anyone who needs to cuddle a soft toy. 
Robin,Rannie,1/22/1975,931, 5.0 , Lovely panda - very soft sturdy well made fully stuffed no floppy bits lovely to cuddle goes everywhere with a 7 year old girl this toy will last. 
Robin,Rannie,1/22/1975,932, 5.0 , I purchased the panda for my grand daughter and it is excellent. It was extremely well made good quality and so soft!! It has become a firm favourite as a bed time companion. 
Blondie,Sobey,1/22/2018,933, 5.0 , My lil girl misplaced her lil bear that she took to bed with her. Uncle Vinnie came and saved the day! Happy child equals a happy mummy...so happy days!... 
Blondie,Sobey,1/22/2018,934, 5.0 , a very cute and cuddly panda lots of personality.  Gets on well with the rest of the hug! will name him after the Edinburgh baby panda when it arrives. 
Blondie,Sobey,1/22/2018,935, 5.0 , I brought this product after pondering for some time not about the quality but about the size I do wish I brought bigger but the feel and quality of the toy is outstanding.This toy was brought for a dear friend of mine I wanted to get her something soft and cute something to hug. The toy stand up to my requirements and more.This bear would be a great gift for anyone looking for something cute and soft suitable for all ages but I wouldnt suggest getting it for your local Get of my lawn! man. 
Blondie,Sobey,1/22/2018,936, 5.0 , arrived quicker than expected very pleased with this. Would definitely purchase again.Good value for money the kids love it. Thanks again 
Blondie,Sobey,1/22/2018,937, 2.0 , It doesnt look anything like picture ! very very small  quiet disappointing really.not what I expected at all. but not to worry.
Wilie,Rake,5/31/1964,938, 5.0 , My daughter age 5 received these a few days ago and is delighted! Im usually not the biggest fan of this type of toy but they are very cute! They dont do an awful lot and its quite tricky to get them so make the sucking noise on the bottle but very cute all the same! They have kept my daughter and her friend busy for ages and are excellent value! (and the batteries they came with are still working!) 
Wilie,Rake,5/31/1964,939, 4.0 , Grandaughters 6 and 3yrs thrilled with these cute puppies. Packaging awkward for little fingers especially on Christmas morning. The little bottle needed to activate sounds could easily get lost so suggest attaching it to stethoscope. The sound of the puppy when away from the other one is heart breaking - so real. Great little toy for the price. Not as much trouble as the real thing!! Enjoy 
Wilie,Rake,5/31/1964,940, 5.0 , This was a great hit with Sofia.  The variety of modes and the fact that there are 2 puppies increases the way the toy can be used.  Great for cooperative play.The heart beat was the best 
Wilie,Rake,5/31/1964,941, 5.0 , My 2 and half year old loves her puppies. I think they are great value for money. And she has spent alot of time feeding the puppies and loving them. Cheaper alterative to the really thing! A great value gift for a childs birthday. 
Wilie,Rake,5/31/1964,942, 4.0 , I bought these for my 6yr old niece and she loved them... However my first order of the puppies didnt arrive but when I wrote to customer service they sorted it out very quickly. Very impressed. 
Wilie,Rake,5/31/1964,943, 5.0 , My 5 yr old loves these.Especially the way they interact with eachother. Very huggable & cute. Her grandparents wanted them too. 
Audrie,O'Cannovane,1/14/1995,944, 3.0 , I unpacked this toy to make sure it worked ok and found that the batteries in one of the dogs was flat. Luckily we had some batteries of the right size so I now have a present pile that barks if you nudge it.Very cute and soft little puppies. I am sure my daughter will love it.
Audrie,O'Cannovane,1/14/1995,945, 5.0 , My wife purchased another limited issue bear and loved it so much she wanted another. Unfortunately she loves this one too so it looks like the start of an expensive trend. Really nice bear.
Audrie,O'Cannovane,1/14/1995,946, 5.0 , lovely for the bear.  :)
Arther,Borkin,11/21/1996,947, 4.0 , Fun colourful Cuddly toy with interesting design which delivers much happiness to tender young things.  My daughter treasures it and takes it everywhere! 
Arther,Borkin,11/21/1996,948, 5.0 , Granddaughter requested pink elephant for her birthday. Was delighted with this one. Well made and fit for purpose. Soft and safe for a bedtime cuddle 
Arther,Borkin,11/21/1996,949, 5.0 , My daughter loves elephants this is her favourite very good quality lovely and soft colours are vibrant. I would recommend
Arther,Borkin,11/21/1996,950, 5.0 , This toy is so cute I would certainly NOT hand it over to a sticky-fingered child to play with.  Ok ok its kid safe but please the critter is so gorgeous youll want to sit it somewhere people can see it and admire it and generally ask what on earth it is.I like soft toys but not the pink and fluffy bunnykins type and this woodhog is whacky enough to appeal to me.  one of the most amusing things is that if you pull the tail the nose gets shorter more like a pig snout and if you pull the snout the tail is shorter.  Play value or what?Definiteley reccomended for the fun factor and it is so well made too. 
Arther,Borkin,11/21/1996,951, 4.0 , Lovely unusual toy. Love that you can pull on the nose/tail it make it longer and it looks cute with the knot on the tail end. To get 5 stars though theyd need to work on the ears. Theyre very cute but the plastic stiffeners that make them stick up came loose very quickly giving flat floppy ears sigh! 
Arther,Borkin,11/21/1996,952, 5.0 , Absolutely adorable adults and children alike love it - a present for a real animal buff who was chuffed with it even if its not a real animal. Tail-nose slides - so either the nose or tail can be longer.
Arther,Borkin,11/21/1996,953, 5.0 , Seen on us website and then found here. Collecting all colours of Hello Kitty.
Cyb,Brayson,4/20/1978,954, 5.0 , Ordered 2 of these for Xmas for my son and nephew....LOVE THEM!! Highly recommend them there a little smaller then normal cuddleuppets but there so soft and cuddly!! 
Cyb,Brayson,4/20/1978,955, 5.0 , Bought 4 different snuggle uppets for the grandchildren brilliant gift - lovely faces and warm soft blanket. Very good value. 
Cyb,Brayson,4/20/1978,956, 5.0 , The original and the best. Be careful as a lot of similar products are available which are not the same quality.
Cyb,Brayson,4/20/1978,957, 5.0 , It was gratefully received by the person I bought it for  very nice frog . good quality toy  a nice present
Cyb,Brayson,4/20/1978,958, 4.0 , My son was really pleased with this Pokemon teddy and it looks just like the character from the cartoon. It wont stand up like in the picture though because it is very top heavy. Good for playing and cuddling though! 
Cyb,Brayson,4/20/1978,959, 5.0 , What a fab product at a brill price came with pokemon lables and is of good quality is bigger than expected u wont get better for the money 
Rolland,Gounin,11/15/1946,960, 5.0 , very well made plushone of my Favorited pokemonstuff and praise that i cant think aboutits very aweomse thank you 
Rolland,Gounin,11/15/1946,961, 3.0 , Love it but when i received it there was a giant HOLE in his foot. So yeah that was very annoying.
Rolland,Gounin,11/15/1946,962, 5.0 , This is a great gift for bird lovers or if you want to give a cuddly toy with a difference.The bird has lovely thick fur and the call was very clear and distinctive. If you were planning on taking a child bird spotting they would have a good idea what they were looking and more importantly listening for.Its nice to see more unusual birds are available rather than just robins and blackbirds.It comes with a small information tag that tells you a bit about the birds habitat and migration patterns which is also quite interesting.
Rolland,Gounin,11/15/1946,963, 5.0 , The seven year old loved it Im getting a little fed up with space ranger Buzz and zoid attacks but that is not the point. Almost two weeks later and he has hardly put it down. Great present Im very pleased with it.
Rolland,Gounin,11/15/1946,964, 5.0 , My son is a chef and wanted a chefs outfit for a build a bear I purchased for him as a fun gift.  The actual build a bear shop had no chefs outfits and I was worried they would not fit the bear but they went on him a treat. 
Rolland,Gounin,11/15/1946,965, 5.0 , Arrived on time. Lovely little outfit.
Rolland,Gounin,11/15/1946,966, 4.0 , This bird is a retired (no longer being made) TY beanie baby called Dinky.American TY Warner invented the first beanie baby in 1986.Each of his beanie babies has their own birthday.This beanies birthday is September 25th 2000.Also each beanie baby has its own heart shaped tag with a poem inside.This beanies poem reads:Alright I know Im a little smallBut whats so great about being tall?Soon Ill grow up and you will seeJust how beautiful I will be!I only gave Dinky a 4 star durability rating because of his paper tag (if constantly read it wont last.)Dinky is surface washable and would make the perfect fun gift for a TY or bird lover. 
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,967, 5.0 , When I saw the picture of Dinky the Duck I thought it looked really cute. When it came I loved it even more it a really colourful beanie and very soft. The tag is the only part that wouldnt last if the teddy was for a child as could tear easily and would need to be removed. Definately worth buying and a great addition to any TY collection. 
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,968, 5.0 , I have chosen this rating as my mum was told she would not ever get one of these and i got her one shes over the moon with it.Thank you 
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,969, 5.0 , This Beanie arrived promplty and was well packaged. It is so cute and has a great feel to it- you just want to keep cuddling it 
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,970, 5.0 , so cute loved it
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,971, 5.0 , Great serviveA+++++
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,972, 5.0 , Really pleased with this item so cuddly and adorable. Good size and arrived swiftly.
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,973, 5.0 , Very cute toy.
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,974, 4.0 , THis lovely soft toy has won the heart of everyone in the family. It arrived very promptly.The only thing I was disappointed with was the size as I was expecting something bigger and if you look at the sizes given on the main page they do not correspond in any way to the real thing plus you dont know the way it is given which is the height lenght width or whatever.Product Dimensions given on the main page: 33 x 15.2 x 12.7 cmReal dimensions: Height=23cm; head width= 15cm; length from front paw to tail=23cmAnyway its a lovely little tiger. As for the durability it is difficult to say how long it will last but the quality of the stitching seems good and all the parts seem well attached to each other so logically it should last a long time. 
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,975, 5.0 , This was bought as a present for my daughter to congratulate her on successful potty training! Whilst the tiger itself is beyond fault the company who supplied it were very slow to despatch. So if youre thinking of buying Id say yes to the quality but buy the item elsewhere if yoh can! 
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,976, 5.0 , Lovely very cute and soft. 
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,977, 5.0 , Great buy 
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,978, 2.0 , Really disappointed with this. My daughter actually said she didnt like it. Other beanie boos are very cute this one is not.
Tomaso,Gratrex,3/19/1964,979, 5.0 , Love my Toy Story alien. Bought for my space-themed reading area in class- now tempted to keep it for myself! 
Abraham,Bartelot,2/11/1995,980, 5.0 , Travels everywhere with us good quality
Abraham,Bartelot,2/11/1995,981, 5.0 , Product is very soft and of great quality. Would definitely reccommend for a child and has no loose parts. Overall a great purchase!
Jo,Cuming,2/6/1997,982, 5.0 , as far as one direction goes - yes great! 
Leonora,Sommers,11/18/2004,983, 5.0 , Quick delivery and a quality item 
Leonora,Sommers,11/18/2004,984, 5.0 , perfect for 1D birthday party
Tannie,Sawle,1/23/1998,985, 5.0 , Its great gift for females good quality and looking very funny. Price is also good. I would recommend it as a Christmas gift too
Tannie,Sawle,1/23/1998,986, 5.0 , love it
Temple,Edmonson,2/7/2015,987, 5.0 , I bought this for my four year old daughter as a treat for being good. After a little more assembly than I thought she started playing with it and continued for the rest of the day.It comes with stickers to decorate the little house and postcards that fit inside the post box - great for imaginative play. Little accessories like a teddy brush and leash complete the experience.The little dog (or hamster as my daughter calls it) skuttles off and if you get it in the house going round the right way it pops out the door for a drink from the little water and food bowls.My two year old also loves it - but has small parts so keep an eye out.Im buying these for her friends birthday parties now.
Temple,Edmonson,2/7/2015,988, 5.0 , Really good product and I know my daughter will love this.  Much more expensive than other styles thats the only bad point 
Temple,Edmonson,2/7/2015,989, 5.0 , Bought this for my daughter she loves her to bitsso soft and a great comforter thanks x 
Temple,Edmonson,2/7/2015,990, 5.0 , This arrived quickly and was well packaged.Its just a lovely idea that if a young one has scary thoughts that they can be wrote down and zipped away in its mouth so to take any fears away.I know my granddaughter will love it.The colour is great and it feels so soft so Im sure it will be good for a cuddle tho be aware of the metal zip across its mouth.This was a great buy and I would certainly buy more in future as presents. 
Temple,Edmonson,2/7/2015,991, 4.0 , Personally I think its a bit expensive and not as big as expected but it hasnt left my daughters side since it arrived. 
Temple,Edmonson,2/7/2015,992, 5.0 , Grandson wanted one for his mum as he hot Flamm and has helped with his worries so hoped it helps his mum 
Jory,Cheales,11/20/1951,993, 5.0 , My granddaughter had to go to evalina childrens hospital in London as she has HSP and her kidneys were getting blood and protein in them....I bought her Pom and it has never been out of her arms it holds magic for her....thank youx 
Jory,Cheales,11/20/1951,994, 5.0 , This is a life saver. My daughter suffers from anxiety and since having this she has been a much brighter little girl and is now beginning to open to me as well as her worry eater. Definitely recommend. 
Jory,Cheales,11/20/1951,995, 5.0 , Perfect way to revise any worries your children may have but feel unable to tell you. My little one has been inseparable from Pom since we bought her.
Jory,Cheales,11/20/1951,996, 3.0 , M daughter is going to love this.However its not cuddly as the wings are a hard  scratchy felt to make them stand up.Such a shame as the body is nice soft material.Lint all over the wings already too.Considering giving it away and buying the more expensive one from a well known build a (dragon) workshop.Good size though. 
Jory,Cheales,11/20/1951,997, 4.0 , one of my daughters favourite toys. Its well made but the wings are a felt like material and they do tend to get fluff stuck to them. It has been everywhere with us and she loves it. We have had it a year and still looks good. Seams are all intact and would recommend this. 
Der,Haill,1/13/1993,998, 3.0 , The quality of the product was good  but the colour of dragon seem more navy blue than black 
Der,Haill,1/13/1993,999, 5.0 , Adorable. Was so happy with the cooperation I received with this item! Thank you! 
Der,Haill,1/13/1993,1000, 4.0 , This is very well made cuddly toy I only thought the wins were a bit flimsy
